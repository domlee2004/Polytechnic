                                In a small town in America,
                                KickFlip Studios was brought to life by 3 friends who set out on an adventure
                                to make skateboarding
                                fun and attractive for everyone.

                                The company was struggling and the 3 friends agreed that
                                a big change was needed for the company to survive.

                                Instead of being the coaches themselves, the friends using their
                                knowledge and passion for skateboarding, hired coaches that were
                                passionate, dedicated and committed. The company was headed for a
                                new direction.

                                KickFlip became the best coaching company for skateboarders and it reached its first 2000 customers.
                                The community was growing rapidly and the customers were enjoying the coaching and KickFlip
                                decided to take a gamble and launch it's own merchandise.

                                The first batch of the merchandise was sold out in days and the friends increased production
                                , quality of material and available designs. Online coaching also became a feature
                                allowing KickFlip to have a global audience.

Object entity: Menu items

Person entity: Driver, Customer

Place entitiy: Restaurant

Attributes are characteristics that describes the entity

e.g of attributes = order no., iterm ordered, qty ordered, contact no.,name

Customer is the entity; customer ID, Name, Contact No, are the attributes

Files based system vs database system

Filebased:
Collection of application programs each managing its own data

In an organization each dept has its own data files (not shared)

Drawbacks: Duplication/wastage of storage, duplication of effort, 
           may lead to unsynced files as if a shared data file is updated 
           it has to be updated multiple times, Cannot share data/ combine data
Databse:
Different dept can share the data in the database; 1 Common database

Database Application lifecycle:
Database planning
System def.
analysis
Database design (what we focus on)
Implementation
Testing
Operational Maintainance

Modelling (in context)
From 3D to 2D (Real world to paper)

Why do we need database:
So that we can easily answer any questions. 
Everything is organized.
e.g. Who are the dentist I can consult?
     When is patient P003 consultation?

When performing Basic Dynamic Analysis
1. Go to control panel check networkconnection -> LAN -> Properties -> TCP/IP -> Properties -> Set DNS to local host
2. This is to fake a network. Otherwise the malware might not run
3. Set DNS Reply Address using Apate DNS to 127.0.0.1 and start the server
4. Start your different software (pe, pm, nc) Netcat listen to traffic on port 80 (http) and 443(https)
5. Regshot (Take 1 before running malware, 1 after and compare). Often times must look at files added or modified
6. MD5 hash to compare files
7. Look back at APATE DNS and Netcat -> (See traffic and DNS requests)
8. Analyze process explorer (View -> Lower Pane View -> Handles/DLL) -> Check for mutex and DLLs files (if it was packed)
8.b Analyze strings of process by going to properties of the process. 
9. Process monitor (must filter processes e.g. by name) 


Tools Used:
1. ApateDNS
2. Process Explorer
3. Process Monitor
4. Regshot
5. WinMD5 (in static analysis)

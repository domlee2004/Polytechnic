Timestamp to know how recent the malware is

Old indicates higher possibility of malware being detected by AV

New indicates otherwise.

Packing is used to make static analysis of malware difficult by malware authors

Makes analyst have to unpack or perform basic dynamic analysis (Run the malware)

Entrypoint indicates memory address which the programme starts in memory

These are 2 indicators of compromise Network and Host-based.

Hostbased Indicators 	- New process/service/thread (e.g. mutex) created, file del, file created, 
				- file modified
	   			- Registry CRUD too (Impt for persistance and configuration)

* CreateMutex CreateProcess e.g. of Hostbased indicator functions
* CreateFile & CreateDir either creates or opens an existing one 
* W at end of function = unicode (all foreign languages) A = Ascii (only english)

Network Indicators      - Connecting to URL, IP address. 
				- Creating socket, connecting to a port
				- Functions such as RPC, WinInet, WS2, IP addresses
Dependency Walker
- Look from highest to lowest level. 

Bintext
- Look for mispelled/funny looking strings
- Look for references to dll files as they might be linked 

* Exported Functions and functions that other programmes can import
* Imported functions are the functions that the malware will be using
* ADVAPI has your registry related functions

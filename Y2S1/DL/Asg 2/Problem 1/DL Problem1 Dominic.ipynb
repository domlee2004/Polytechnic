      "I have been using this app since 2 years nd was going through a delightful experience but today I faced a Bug. I was unable to send a message even though my internet connection was very fast other apps were working smoothly but Snapchat wasn't. I have looked out my account nd logged it again ,i have cleared the chaches,i have updated it but this was of no use unfortunately. It's a request to solve this problem as soon as possible so that we can carry forth our experiences with snapcht and team.\n",

      "I can get past the garbage camera quality, I understand that developing an app to talk to every camera in the Android world is no easy feat. What I can't get past is the fact that Snapchat on Android looks so utterly different and is so much less user friendly than what my iPhone friends have. We're missing features in the Android version that are so easy to implement that there is no reason they shouldn't already be a part of the app. For example, I was just on a video call with a friend and found out that while on Android, we only have that tiny little circle, where you can barely see whats showing on the other person's screen, the Apple version has basically the same design as FaceTime. You can see the whole of what the other person sees, you can make your own video the focus, it overall just looks better and is easier to use. There's no reason whatsoever that the versions should be noticeably different. A large portion of the app works in very similar ways, whether it just looks better on Apple or it functions significantly better. The Android version even fails to include a dark mode, which the Apple version has had for a few months already. We've gone through multiple updates on our side and still can't even add a feature as simple as a dark mode? Overall, Snapchat just works better on Apple and its infuriating. There's no reason we can't have the same quality of application that the Apple crowd has access to, aside from the camera of course.\n",

      "I love snapchat. I also use it to communicate to my younger cousin who doesn't have a phone number but has an iPad. Although the one thing I dislike is you can't customize your \"icon\" to be something thats not your bitmoji, example, say i would like to change my \"icon\" to a picture of the beach, I cannot, it can only be my bitmoji. So thats one factor i highly dislike. I also highly dislike that you cannot change your \"username\" until a year passes.\n",

I know there are many types of android devices but I wish that SC worked harder to make the quality and use of SC on android devices much more advanced and less laggy. When using SC on my S22 Ultra, SC lags alot and barely let's me use the camera...and where's the dark mode for android?!? better the app.\n",

      "Glitchy and if you scroll too down to saved snaps it starts hanging your whole device and also takes too much time to save snaps to my eyes only. This app has so less space on the server that is why our chats cannot be saved for more than 24 hours unless we save some chats. The less server space unables people to use this app smoothly. Fix this or i may delete this damn app and recommend others not to use this app and use other apps like instagram etc.\n",

Allow people to send ads they are shown to their friend or story. You guys are missing out on free marketing. 4. Make your subscribed stories on the discover panel bigger. Why are the things I'm not subscribed to 4x bigger? 5. Make people in the memes panel mark sexual content, and let me turn that content off, this aint onlyfans bruh.\n",

      "This is the only \"social media\" app I use and i love it. Snapchat started it all. The memories, the stories, and the filters. They care about your privacy and use encryption so your data is secure. The only downside to this app is the discover page. Its full of clickbait and its basically what anti-social media users like me want to avoid. I wish there was an option to disable it but there isnt. This app would be 5/5 if I could disable it, but i understand it is probably how they make their $$$\n",

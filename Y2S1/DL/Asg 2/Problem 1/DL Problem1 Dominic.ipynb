      "Overall good app for messaging friends, video calling, meeting new people and entertainment. However, the Android app is absolutely horrendous, missing KEY features such as pinning people and dark mode. There is such little attention payed to the Android version. It uses deprecated camera APIs, has performance issues and bugs all over, lack of basic features and slow updates. Snapchat have finally started adding new features, but have left old ones out. Please show the Android version more love.\n",

They gotta stop those fake accounts where people somehow manage to send snaps and/or videos of nude women to try to make you send nudes back. Then send them to people you know as blackmail until you pay them. The accounts are obviously fake but they can somehow manipulate what you can and can't see. I know of 2 people already who have committed suicide because of this. Snapchat needs to make sure people can't keep doing this.\n",

      "I can get past the garbage camera quality, I understand that developing an app to talk to every camera in the Android world is no easy feat. What I can't get past is the fact that Snapchat on Android looks so utterly different and is so much less user friendly than what my iPhone friends have. We're missing features in the Android version that are so easy to implement that there is no reason they shouldn't already be a part of the app. For example, I was just on a video call with a friend and found out that while on Android, we only have that tiny little circle, where you can barely see whats showing on the other person's screen, the Apple version has basically the same design as FaceTime. You can see the whole of what the other person sees, you can make your own video the focus, it overall just looks better and is easier to use. There's no reason whatsoever that the versions should be noticeably different. A large portion of the app works in very similar ways, whether it just looks better on Apple or it functions significantly better. The Android version even fails to include a dark mode, which the Apple version has had for a few months already. We've gone through multiple updates on our side and still can't even add a feature as simple as a dark mode? Overall, Snapchat just works better on Apple and its infuriating. There's no reason we can't have the same quality of application that the Apple crowd has access to, aside from the camera of course.\n",

      "snapchat has been a very good app over the past 5 years I've been using jt.... although there are some recent features that I think could use some fixing/updating. for instance, when using a sound from the music option, when you record lip syncing/dancing, it doesn't match with the video in editing so you have to trim it till its synced.. another thing, when trimming videos it can be extremely glitch. by this I mean lagging to the first slit second of the video and only replaying the first part\n",

So thats one factor i highly dislike. I also highly dislike that you cannot change your \"username\" until a year passes.\n",

For example, iPhone has a dark mode option, and you can set emojis for certain things for people, and you can pin your favorite person. Its not a big deal, but these small things are lowkey just nice to have. I would love to have dark mode on. I would change my rating if you guys gave us what you give iPhone.

      "it's a great app yeah, it's a little weird when it notifies the chat you you've done this and that, but it's still good. the main issue I have is when I take a picture, before it looks very detailed and really well, after I take it it gets simplified? is how to say it? it gets simplified and less detailed. I just wanna know if this happens because of the phone or for data/wifi overall a pretty good app\n",

      "I love it but it has some issues to it, nothing major but something that has been bothering me for some time now. Recently I havent been receiving my messages through notification from the app, so I have no idea if I am being messaged or not unless I look and open the app myself. Notifications are on and the permissions for it in the app are on too so I'm not sure why it's never showing me my messages. Other than that, the app works great and I havent found any other issues involving it.\n",

But I have got two things that I've seen and that I agree on. One, dark mode for android so that it isn't as brightat night when it's dark in your room. Two, pin people on android so when there is someone specialyou don't have to scroll through your contacts to look for them. These small changes would make a huge difference for android users.\n",

Allow people to send ads they are shown to their friend or story. You guys are missing out on free marketing. 4. Make your subscribed stories on the discover panel bigger. Why are the things I'm not subscribed to 4x bigger? 5. Make people in the memes panel mark sexual content, and let me turn that content off, this aint onlyfans bruh.\n",

They care about your privacy and use encryption so your data is secure. The only downside to this app is the discover page. Its full of clickbait and its basically what anti-social media users like me want to avoid. I wish there was an option to disable it but there isnt. This app would be 5/5 if I could disable it, but i understand it is probably how they make their $$$\n",

Secondly Samsung users don't have the option to have dark mode. I would like to see these added to snapchat for there Samsung users so it can be a better app for them.

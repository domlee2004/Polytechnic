disney had great entertainment alwaysespecially these time youre stuck home of virusfamily took something knew see you already paying a subscription theyre asking pay additional 30 watch new movie malon hard do most everyone is laid or losing job money being so tight just to pay bill to live and eat look like would price more economically there customer,2
great all age sure season dont come example penny mar is season 1 2 there but season 3 isnt wa diasapointed that why we pay extra to see movie we already paying for everything else,2

option viewing excellent the constant load time continuously not we pay this personally be canceling subscription this doesnt get fixed none my streaming subscription this issue,2
although good service have all content one spot theyre focused quantity rather quality personally think app is unnecessary since disney wanted money removed their entire library movie show streaming service up whether not you think worth the subscription warned you wont be able find the majority this content any other streaming service,2
love disney being able watch the movie show it frustrating my account now hacked twice,2
good,2
tried watching disney plus my tablet worked couple day stopped working tried watch took forever load it never worked please fix issue have a samsung and dont know thats it but i tried every thing,2
due fact it still it infancy isnt incredibly great selection if love disney could easily find something worth watching the future promising show marvel star war coming the mandalorian a complete first season stick around itll worth the wait,2

of best exclusive content any streaming service must sub any marvel star war fan any one child a child heart love disney only thing holding back 5 is policy new movie i not like charging much extra a rental,3
app isnt bad actually rather good just wish episode posted reasonable time instead posted entire season dont cable watch episode live television i want actually watch the episode come or a little after they come one example being the owl house season 2 is just airing 3 episode already however none them are on disney plus than it great,3
good the part when download episode ha error sometimes deletes episode,3

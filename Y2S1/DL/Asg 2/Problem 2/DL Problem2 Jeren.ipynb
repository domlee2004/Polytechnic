       "'/ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe boy who lived \\n\\nmr. and mrs. dursley, of number four, privet drive, \\nwere proud to say that they were perfectly normal, \\nthank you very much. they were the last people you’d \\nexpect to be involved in anything strange or \\nmysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such \\nnonsense. \\n\\nmr. dursley was the director of a firm called \\ngrunnings, which made drills. he was a big, beefy \\nman with hardly any neck, although he did have a \\nvery large mustache. mrs. dursley was thin and \\nblonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \\nneck, which came in very useful as she spent so \\nmuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying \\non the neighbors. the dursley s had a small son \\ncalled dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \\nboy anywhere. \\n\\nthe dursleys had everything they wanted, but they \\nalso had a secret, and their greatest fear was that \\nsomebody would discover it. they didn’t think they \\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the potters. \\nmrs. potter was mrs. dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t \\n\\npage | 2 \\n\\n\\n\\nmet for several years; in fact, mrs. dursley pretended \\nshe didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her \\ngood-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it \\nwas possible to be. the dursleys shuddered to think \\nwhat the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in \\nthe street. the dursleys knew that the potters had a \\nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. \\n\\nthis boy was another good reason for keeping the \\npotters away; they didn’t want dudley mixing with a \\nchild like that. \\n\\nwhen mr. and mrs. dursley woke up on the dull, gray \\ntuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \\ncloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over \\nthe country. mr. dursley hummed as he picked out \\nhis most boring tie for work, and mrs. dursley \\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \\ndudley into his high chair. \\n\\nnone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \\nthe window. \\n\\nat half past eight, mr. dursley picked up his \\nbriefcase, pecked mrs. dursley on the cheek, and \\ntried to kiss dudley good-bye but missed, because \\ndudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \\ncereal at the walls. “little tyke,” chortled mr. dursley \\nas he left the house. he got into his car and backed \\nout of number four’s drive. \\n\\nit was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \\nfirst sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a \\nmap. for a second, mr. dursley didn’t realize what he \\nhad seen — then he jerked his head around to look \\nagain. there was a tabby cat standing on the corner \\nof privet drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. what \\ncould he have been thinking of? it must have been a \\ntrick of the light. mr. dursley blinked and stared at \\npage | 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe cat. it stared back. as mr. dursley drove around \\nthe corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his \\nmirror. it was now reading the sign that said privet \\ndrive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read \\nmaps or signs. mr. dursley gave himself a little shake \\nand put the cat out of his mind. as he drove toward \\ntown he thought of nothing except a large order of \\ndrills he was hoping to get that day. \\n\\nbut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his \\nmind by something else. as he sat in the usual \\nmorning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that \\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \\nabout. people in cloaks. mr. dursley couldn’t bear \\npeople who dressed in funny clothes — the getups \\nyou saw on young people! he supposed this was some \\nstupid new fashion. he drummed his fingers on the \\nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \\nweirdos standing quite close by. they were whispering \\nexcitedly together. mr. dursley was enraged to see \\nthat a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that \\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an \\nemerald-green cloak! the nerve of him! but then it \\nstruck mr. dursley that this was probably some silly \\nstunt — these people were obviously collecting for \\nsomething ... yes, that would be it. the traffic moved \\non and a few minutes later, mr. dursley arrived in the \\ngrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \\n\\nmr. dursley always sat with his back to the window in \\nhis office on the ninth floor. if he hadn’t, he might \\nhave found it harder to concentrate on drills that \\nmorning. he didn’t see the owls swooping past in \\nbroad daylight, though people down in the street did; \\nthey pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \\nowl sped overhead. most of them had never seen an \\nowl even at nighttime. mr. dursley, however, had a \\nperfectly normal, owl-free morning. he yelled at five \\ndifferent people. he made several important telephone \\npage | 4 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncalls and shouted a bit more. he was in a very good \\nmood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch \\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \\nbun from the bakery. \\n\\nhe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \\npassed a group of them next to the baker’s. he eyed \\nthem angrily as he passed. he didn’t know why, but \\nthey made him uneasy. this bunch were whispering \\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting \\ntin. it was on his way back past them, clutching a \\nlarge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words \\nof what they were saying. \\n\\n“the potters, that’s right, that’s what i heard — ” \\n\\n“ — yes, their son, harry — ” \\n\\nmr. dursley stopped dead. fear flooded him. he \\nlooked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say \\nsomething to them, but thought better of it. \\n\\nhe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his \\noffice, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, \\nseized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing \\nhis home number when he changed his mind. he put \\nthe receiver back down and stroked his mustache, \\nthinking ... no, he was being stupid. potter wasn’t \\nsuch an unusual name. he was sure there were lots \\nof people called potter who had a son called harry. \\ncome to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew \\nwas called harry. he’d never even seen the boy. it \\nmight have been harvey. or harold. there was no \\npoint in worrying mrs. dursley; she always got so \\nupset at any mention of her sister. he didn’t blame \\nher — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the \\nsame, those people in cloaks ... \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 5 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \\nafternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, \\nhe was still so worried that he walked straight into \\nsomeone just outside the door. \\n\\n“sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled \\nand almost fell. it was a few seconds before mr. \\ndursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \\ncloak. he didn’t seem at all upset at being almost \\nknocked to the ground. on the contrary, his face split \\ninto a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \\nmade passersby stare, “don’t be sorry, my dear sir, \\nfor nothing could upset me today! rejoice, for you- \\nknow-who has gone at last! even muggles like \\nyourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \\nday!” \\n\\nand the old man hugged mr. dursley around the \\nmiddle and walked off. \\n\\nmr. dursley stood rooted to the spot. he had been \\nhugged by a complete stranger. he also thought he \\nhad been called a muggle, whatever that was. he was \\nrattled. he hurried to his car and set off for home, \\nhoping he was imagining things, which he had never \\nhoped before, because he didn’t approve of \\nimagination. \\n\\nas he pulled into the driveway of number four, the \\nfirst thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — \\nwas the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. it was \\nnow sitting on his garden wall. he was sure it was the \\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \\n\\n“shoo!” said mr. dursley loudly. \\n\\nthe cat didn’t move. it just gave him a stern look. \\n\\nwas this normal cat behavior? mr. dursley wondered. \\ntrying to pull himself together, he let himself into the \\n\\npage | 6 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhouse. he was still determined not to mention \\nanything to his wife. \\n\\nmrs. dursley had had a nice, normal day. she told \\nhim over dinner all about mrs. next door’s problems \\nwith her daughter and how dudley had learned a new \\nword (“won’t!”). mr. dursley tried to act normally. \\nwhen dudley had been put to bed, he went into the \\nliving room in time to catch the last report on the \\nevening news: \\n\\n“and finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported \\nthat the nation’s owls have been behaving very \\nunusually today. although owls normally hunt at \\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have \\nbeen hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \\nevery direction since sunrise. experts are unable to \\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their \\nsleeping pattern.” the newscaster allowed himself a \\ngrin. “most mysterious. and now, over to jim \\nmcguffin with the weather. going to be any more \\nshowers of owls tonight, jim?” \\n\\n“well, ted,” said the weatherman, “i don’t know about \\nthat, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting \\noddly today. viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, \\nand dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \\ninstead of the rain i promised yesterday, they’ve had a \\ndownpour of shooting stars! perhaps people have \\nbeen celebrating bonfire night early — it’s not until \\nnext week, folks! but i can promise a wet night \\ntonight.” \\n\\nmr. dursley sat frozen in his armchair. shooting stars \\nall over britain? owls flying by daylight? mysterious \\npeople in cloaks all over the place? and a whisper, a \\nwhisper about the potters . . . \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 7 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmrs. dursley came into the living room carrying two \\ncups of tea. it was no good. he’d have to say \\nsomething to her. he cleared his throat nervously. “er \\n— petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister \\nlately, have you?” \\n\\nas he had expected, mrs. dursley looked shocked and \\nangry. after all, they normally pretended she didn’t \\nhave a sister. \\n\\n“no,” she said sharply. “why?” \\n\\n“funny stuff on the news,” mr. dursley mumbled. \\n“owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \\nfunny-looking people in town today ...” \\n\\n“so?” snapped mrs. dursley. \\n\\n“well, i just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \\ndo with ... you know ... her crowd.” \\n\\nmrs. dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. mr. \\ndursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d \\nheard the name “potter.” he decided he didn’t dare. \\ninstead he said, as casually as he could, “their son — \\nhe’d be about dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” \\n\\n“i suppose so,” said mrs. dursley stiffly. \\n\\n“what’s his name again? howard, isn’t it?” \\n\\n“harry. nasty, common name, if you ask me.” \\n\\n“oh, yes,” said mr. dursley, his heart sinking \\nhorribly. “yes, i quite agree.” \\n\\nhe didn’t say another word on the subject as they \\nwent upstairs to bed. while mrs. dursley was in the \\nbathroom, mr. dursley crept to the bedroom window \\n\\npage | 8 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand peered down into the front garden. the cat was \\nstill there. it was staring down privet drive as though \\nit were waiting for something. \\n\\nwas he imagining things? could all this have \\nanything to do with the potters? if it did ... if it got out \\nthat they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t \\nthink he could bear it. \\n\\nthe dursleys got into bed. mrs. dursley fell asleep \\nquickly but mr. dursley lay awake, turning it all over \\nin his mind. his last, comforting thought before he fell \\nasleep was that even if the potters were involved, \\nthere was no reason for them to come near him and \\nmrs. dursley. the potters knew very well what he and \\npetunia thought about them and their kind. ... he \\ncouldn’t see how he and petunia could get mixed up \\nin anything that might be going on — he yawned and \\nturned over — it couldn’t affect them. ... \\n\\nhow very wrong he was. \\n\\nmr. dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \\nsleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \\nsign of sleepiness. it was sitting as still as a statue, \\nits eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet \\ndrive. it didn’t so much as quiver when a car door \\nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls \\nswooped overhead. in fact, it was nearly midnight \\nbefore the cat moved at all. \\n\\na man appeared on the corner the cat had been \\nwatching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d \\nhave thought he’d just popped out of the ground. the \\ncat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \\n\\nnothing like this man had ever been seen on privet \\ndrive. he was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \\nsilver of his hair and beard, which were both long \\n\\npage | 9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nenough to tuck into his belt. he was wearing long \\nrobes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \\nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. his blue eyes were light, \\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \\nand his nose was very long and crooked, as though it \\nhad been broken at least twice. this man’s name was \\nalbus dumbledore. \\n\\nalbus dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had \\njust arrived in a street where everything from his \\nname to his boots was unwelcome. he was busy \\nrummaging in his cloak, looking for something. but \\nhe did seem to realize he was being watched, because \\nhe looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. for \\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \\nhim. he chuckled and muttered, “i should have \\nknown.” \\n\\nhe found what he was looking for in his inside \\npocket. it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. he \\nflicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. \\nthe nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. he \\nclicked it again — the next lamp flickered into \\ndarkness. twelve times he clicked the put-outer, \\nuntil the only lights left on the whole street were two \\ntiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of \\nthe cat watching him. if anyone looked out of their \\nwindow now, even beady-eyed mrs. dursley, they \\nwouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening \\ndown on the pavement. dumbledore slipped the put- \\nouter back inside his cloak and set off down the \\nstreet toward number four, where he sat down on the \\nwall next to the cat. he didn’t look at it, but after a \\nmoment he spoke to it. \\n\\n“fancy seeing you here, professor mcgonagall.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. \\ninstead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking \\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its \\neyes. she, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \\nher black hair was drawn into a tight bun. she \\nlooked distinctly ruffled. \\n\\n“how did you know it was me?” she asked. \\n\\n“my dear professor, i’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” \\n\\n“you’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all \\nday,” said professor mcgonagall. \\n\\n“all day? when you could have been celebrating? i \\nmust have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \\nway here.” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrily. \\n\\n“oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said \\nimpatiently. “you’d think they’d be a bit more careful, \\nbut no — even the muggles have noticed something’s \\ngoing on. it was on their news.” she jerked her head \\nback at the dursleys’ dark living-room window. “i \\nheard it. flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... well, \\nthey’re not completely stupid. they were bound to \\nnotice something. shooting stars down in kent — i’ll \\nbet that was dedalus diggle. he never had much \\nsense.” \\n\\n“you can’t blame them,” said dumbledore gently. \\n“we’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven \\nyears.” \\n\\n“i know that,” said professor mcgonagall irritably. \\n\\n“but that’s no reason to lose our heads. people are \\nbeing downright careless, out on the streets in broad \\n\\npage | 11 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndaylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, \\nswapping rumors.” \\n\\nshe threw a sharp, sideways glance at dumbledore \\nhere, as though hoping he was going to tell her \\nsomething, but he didn’t, so she went on. “a fine \\nthing it would be if, on the very day you-know-who \\nseems to have disappeared at last, the muggles found \\nout about us all. i suppose he really has gone, \\ndumbledore?” \\n\\n“it certainly seems so,” said dumbledore. “we have \\nmuch to be thankful for. would you care for a lemon \\ndrop?” \\n\\n“a what?” \\n\\n“a lemon drop. they’re a kind of muggle sweet i’m \\nrather fond of.” \\n\\n“no, thank you,” said professor mcgonagall coldly, as \\nthough she didn’t think this was the moment for \\nlemon drops. “as i say, even if you-know-who has \\ngone — ” \\n\\n“my dear professor, surely a sensible person like \\nyourself can call him by his name? all this you- \\nknow-who’ nonsense — for eleven years i have been \\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper \\nname: voldemort.” professor mcgonagall flinched, but \\ndumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, \\nseemed not to notice. “it all gets so confusing if we \\nkeep saying you-know-who.’ i have never seen any \\nreason to be frightened of saying voldemort’s name.” \\n\\n“i know you haven’t,” said professor mcgonagall, \\nsounding half exasperated, half admiring. “but you’re \\ndifferent. everyone knows you’re the only one you- \\nknow- oh, all right, voldemort, was frightened of.” \\n\\npage | 12 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you flatter me,” said dumbledore calmly. “voldemort \\nhad powers i will never have.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“only because you’re too — well — noble to use \\nthem.” \\n\\n“it’s lucky it’s dark. i haven’t blushed so much since \\nmadam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at \\ndumbledore and said, “the owls are nothing next to \\nthe rumors that are flying around. you know what \\neveryone’s saying? about why he’s disappeared? \\n\\nabout what finally stopped him?” \\n\\nit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the \\npoint she was most anxious to discuss, the real \\nreason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all \\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she \\nfixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she \\ndid now. it was plain that whatever “everyone” was \\nsaying, she was not going to believe it until \\ndumbledore told her it was true. dumbledore, \\nhowever, was choosing another lemon drop and did \\nnot answer. \\n\\n“what they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last \\nnight voldemort turned up in godric’s hollow. he \\nwent to find the potters. the rumor is that lily and \\njames potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” \\n\\ndumbledore bowed his head. professor mcgonagall \\ngasped. \\n\\n“lily and james ... i can’t believe it ... i didn’t want to \\nbelieve it ... oh, albus ...” \\n\\ndumbledore reached out and patted her on the \\nshoulder. “i know ... i know ...” he said heavily. \\n\\npage | 13 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall’s voice trembled as she went \\non. “that’s not all. they’re saying he tried to kill the \\npotters’ son, harry. but — he couldn’t. he couldn’t \\nkill that little boy. no one knows why, or how, but \\nthey’re saying that when he couldn’t kill harry potter, \\nvoldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why \\nhe’s gone.” \\n\\ndumbledore nodded glumly. \\n\\n“it’s — it’s true?” faltered professor mcgonagall. “after \\nall he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t \\nkill a little boy? it’s just astounding ... of all the \\nthings to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven \\ndid harry survive?” \\n\\n“we can only guess,” said dumbledore. “we may \\nnever know.” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief \\nand dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. \\ndumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden \\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. it was a very \\nodd watch. it had twelve hands but no numbers; \\ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. it \\nmust have made sense to dumbledore, though, \\nbecause he put it back in his pocket and said, \\n“hagrid’s late. i suppose it was he who told you i’d be \\nhere, by the way?” \\n\\n“yes,” said professor mcgonagall. “and i don’t \\nsuppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all \\nplaces?” \\n\\n“i’ve come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle. \\nthey’re the only family he has left now.” \\n\\n“you don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who \\nlive here?” cried professor mcgonagall, jumping to her \\n\\npage | 14 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfeet and pointing at number four. “dumbledore — you \\ncan’t. i’ve been watching them all day. you couldn’t \\nfind two people who are less like us. and they’ve got \\nthis son — i saw him kicking his mother all the way \\nup the street, screaming for sweets. harry potter \\ncome and live here!” \\n\\n“it’s the best place for him,” said dumbledore firmly. \\n“his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything \\nto him when he’s older. i’ve written them a letter.” \\n\\n“a letter?” repeated professor mcgonagall faintly, \\nsitting back down on the wall. “really, dumbledore, \\nyou think you can explain all this in a letter? these \\npeople will never understand him! he’ll be famous — \\na legend — i wouldn’t be surprised if today was \\nknown as harry potter day in the future — there will \\nbe books written about harry — every child in our \\nworld will know his name!” \\n\\n“exactly,” said dumbledore, looking very seriously \\nover the top of his half-moon glasses. “it would be \\nenough to turn any boy’s head. famous before he can \\nwalk and talk! famous for something he won’t even \\nremember! can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, \\ngrowing up away from all that until he’s ready to take \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth, changed her \\nmind, swallowed, and then said, “yes — yes, you’re \\nright, of course. but how is the boy getting here, \\ndumbledore?” she eyed his cloak suddenly as though \\nshe thought he might be hiding harry underneath it. \\n\\n“hagrid’s bringing him.” \\n\\n“you think it — wise — to trust hagrid with \\nsomething as important as this?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 15 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i would trust hagrid with my life,” said dumbledore. \\n\\n“i’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said \\nprofessor mcgonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t \\npretend he’s not careless. he does tend to — what \\nwas that?” \\n\\na low rumbling sound had broken the silence around \\nthem. it grew steadily louder as they looked up and \\ndown the street for some sign of a headlight; it \\nswelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — \\nand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed \\non the road in front of them. \\n\\nif the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man \\nsitting astride it. he was almost twice as tall as a \\nnormal man and at least five times as wide. he looked \\nsimply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long \\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \\nface, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his \\nfeet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. in \\nhis vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of \\nblankets. \\n\\n“hagrid,” said dumbledore, sounding relieved. “at \\nlast. and where did you get that motorcycle?” \\n\\n“borrowed it, professor dumbledore, sir,” said the \\ngiant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he \\nspoke. “young sirius black lent it to me. i’ve got him, \\nsir.” \\n\\n“no problems, were there?” \\n\\n“no, sir — house was almost destroyed, but i got him \\nout all right before the muggles started swarmin’ \\naround. he fell asleep as we was flyin’ over bristol.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 16 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward \\nover the bundle of blankets. inside, just visible, was a \\nbaby boy, fast asleep. under a tuft of jet-black hair \\nover his forehead they could see a curiously shaped \\ncut, like a bolt of lightning. \\n\\n“is that where — ?” whispered professor mcgonagall. \\n\\n“yes,” said dumbledore. “hell have that scar forever.” \\n\\n“couldn’t you do something about it, dumbledore?” \\n\\n“even if i could, i wouldn’t. scars can come in handy. \\n\\ni have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect \\nmap of the london underground. well — give him \\nhere, hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” \\n\\ndumbledore took harry in his arms and turned \\ntoward the dursleys’ house. \\n\\n“could i — could i say good-bye to him, sir?” asked \\nhagrid. he bent his great, shaggy head over harry \\nand gave him what must have been a very scratchy, \\nwhiskery kiss. then, suddenly, hagrid let out a howl \\nlike a wounded dog. \\n\\n“shhh!” hissed professor mcgonagall, “you’ll wake the \\nmuggles!” \\n\\n“s-s-sorry,” sobbed hagrid, taking out a large, spotted \\nhandkerchief and burying his face in it. “but i c-c- \\ncan’t stand it — lily an’ james dead — an’ poor little \\nharry off ter live with muggles — ” \\n\\n“yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, \\nhagrid, or we’ll be found,” professor mcgonagall \\nwhispered, patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as \\ndumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and \\nwalked to the front door. he laid harry gently on the \\npage | 17 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it \\ninside harry’s blankets, and then came back to the \\nother two. for a full minute the three of them stood \\nand looked at the little bundle; hagrid’s shoulders \\nshook, professor mcgonagall blinked furiously, and \\nthe twinkling light that usually shone from \\ndumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. \\n\\n“well,” said dumbledore finally, “that’s that. we’ve no \\nbusiness staying here. we may as well go and join the \\ncelebrations.” \\n\\n“yeah,” said hagrid in a very muffled voice, “i’d best \\nget this bike away. g ’night, professor mcgonagall — \\nprofessor dumbledore, sir.” \\n\\nwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, hagrid \\nswung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the \\nengine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off \\ninto the night. \\n\\n“i shall see you soon, i expect, professor mcgonagall,” \\nsaid dumbledore, nodding to her. professor \\nmcgonagall blew her nose in reply. \\n\\ndumbledore turned and walked back down the street. \\non the corner he stopped and took out the silver put- \\nouter. he clicked it once, and twelve balls of light \\nsped back to their street lamps so that privet drive \\nglowed suddenly orange and he could make out a \\ntabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end \\nof the street. he could just see the bundle of blankets \\non the step of number four. \\n\\n“good luck, harry,” he murmured. he turned on his \\nheel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. \\n\\na breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive, which \\nlay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last \\n\\npage | 18 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplace you would expect astonishing things to happen. \\nharry potter rolled over inside his blankets without \\nwaking up. one small hand closed on the letter \\nbeside him and he slept on, not knowing he was \\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he \\nwould be woken in a few hours’ time by mrs. \\n\\ndursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put \\nout the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next \\nfew weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin \\ndudley. ... he couldn’t know that at this very \\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country \\nwere holding up their glasses and saying in hushed \\nvoices: “to harry potter — the boy who lived!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 19 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe vanashig glass \\n\\nnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had \\nwoken up to find their nephew on the front step, but \\nprivet drive had hardly changed at all. the sun rose \\non the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \\nnumber four on the dursleys’ front door; it crept into \\ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same \\nas it had been on the night when mr. dursley had \\nseen that fateful news report about the owls. only the \\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \\nmuch time had passed. ten years ago, there had been \\nlots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \\nball wearing different-colored bonnets — but dudley \\ndursley was no longer a baby, and now the \\nphotographs showed a large blond boy riding his first \\nbicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer \\ngame with his father, being hugged and kissed by his \\nmother. the room held no sign at all that another boy \\nlived in the house, too. \\n\\nyet harry potter was still there, asleep at the moment, \\nbut not for long. his aunt petunia was awake and it \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 20 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwas her shrill voice that made the first noise of the \\nday. \\n\\n“up! get up! now!” \\n\\nharry woke with a start. his aunt rapped on the door \\nagain. \\n\\n“up!” she screeched. harry heard her walking toward \\nthe kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan \\nbeing put on the stove. he rolled onto his back and \\ntried to remember the dream he had been having. it \\nhad been a good one. there had been a flying \\nmotorcycle in it. he had a funny feeling he’d had the \\nsame dream before. \\n\\nhis aunt was back outside the door. \\n\\n“are you up yet?” she demanded. \\n\\n“nearly,” said harry. \\n\\n“well, get a move on, i want you to look after the \\nbacon. and don’t you dare let it burn, i want \\neverything perfect on duddy’s birthday.” \\n\\nharry groaned. \\n\\n“what did you say?” his aunt snapped through the \\ndoor. \\n\\n“nothing, nothing ...” \\n\\ndudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? \\nharry got slowly out of bed and started looking for \\nsocks. he found a pair under his bed and, after \\npulling a spider off one of them, put them on. harry \\nwas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \\nstairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \\npage | 21 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the \\nkitchen. the table was almost hidden beneath all \\ndudley’s birthday presents. it looked as though \\ndudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not \\nto mention the second television and the racing bike. \\nexactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a \\nmystery to harry, as dudley was very fat and hated \\nexercise — unless of course it involved punching \\nsomebody. dudley’s favorite punching bag was harry, \\nbut he couldn’t often catch him. harry didn’t look it, \\nbut he was very fast. \\n\\nperhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \\ncupboard, but harry had always been small and \\nskinny for his age. he looked even smaller and \\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to \\nwear were old clothes of dudley’s, and dudley was \\nabout four times bigger than he was. harry had a thin \\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green \\neyes. he wore round glasses held together with a lot \\nof scotch tape because of all the times dudley had \\npunched him on the nose. the only thing harry liked \\nabout his own appearance was a very thin scar on his \\nforehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. he \\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the \\nfirst question he could ever remember asking his \\naunt petunia was how he had gotten it. \\n\\n“in the car crash when your parents died,” she had \\nsaid. “and don’t ask questions.” \\n\\ndon’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a \\nquiet life with the dursleys. \\n\\nuncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was \\nturning over the bacon. \\n\\n“comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning \\ngreeting. \\n\\npage | 22 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nabout once a week, uncle vernon looked over the top \\nof his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a \\nhaircut. harry must have had more haircuts than the \\nrest of the boys in his class put together, but it made \\nno difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over \\nthe place. \\n\\nharry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in \\nthe kitchen with his mother. dudley looked a lot like \\nuncle vernon. he had a large pink face, not much \\nneck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair \\nthat lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. aunt petunia \\noften said that dudley looked like a baby angel — \\nharry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a \\nwig. \\n\\nharry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, \\nwhich was difficult as there wasn’t much room. \\ndudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. his \\nface fell. \\n\\n“thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and \\nfather. “that’s two less than last year.” \\n\\n“darling, you haven’t counted auntie marge’s present, \\nsee, it’s here under this big one from mommy and \\ndaddy.” \\n\\n“all right, thirty-seven then,” said dudley, going red \\nin the face. harry, who could see a huge dudley \\ntantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as \\nfast as possible in case dudley turned the table over. \\n\\naunt petunia obviously scented danger, too, because \\nshe said quickly, “and we’ll buy you another two \\npresents while we’re out today. how’s that, popkin? \\ntwo more presents. is that all right?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 23 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndudley thought for a moment. it looked like hard \\nwork. finally he said slowly, “so i’ll have thirty ... \\nthirty ...” \\n\\n“thirty-nine, sweetums,” said aunt petunia. \\n\\n“oh.” dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the \\nnearest parcel. “all right then.” \\n\\nuncle vernon chuckled. \\n\\n“little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his \\nfather. ’atta boy, dudley!” he ruffled dudley’s hair. \\n\\nat that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia \\nwent to answer it while harry and uncle vernon \\nwatched dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video \\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new \\ncomputer games, and a vcr. he was ripping the \\npaper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came \\nback from the telephone looking both angry and \\nworried. \\n\\n“bad news, vernon,” she said. “mrs. figg’s broken her \\nleg. she can’t take him.” she jerked her head in \\nharry’s direction. \\n\\ndudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but harry’s heart \\ngave a leap. every year on dudley’s birthday, his \\nparents took him and a friend out for the day, to \\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the \\nmovies. every year, harry was left behind with mrs. \\nfigg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. \\n\\nharry hated it there. the whole house smelled of \\ncabbage and mrs. figg made him look at photographs \\nof all the cats she’d ever owned. \\n\\n“now what?” said aunt petunia, looking furiously at \\nharry as though he’d planned this. harry knew he \\n\\npage | 24 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nought to feel sorry that mrs. figg had broken her leg, \\nbut it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would \\nbe a whole year before he had to look at tibbies, \\nsnowy, mr. paws, and tufty again. \\n\\n“we could phone marge,” uncle vernon suggested. \\n\\n“don’t be silly, vernon, she hates the boy.” \\n\\nthe dursleys often spoke about harry like this, as \\nthough he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was \\nsomething very nasty that couldn’t understand them, \\nlike a slug. \\n\\n“what about what’s-her-name, your friend — \\nyvonne?” \\n\\n“on vacation in majorca,” snapped aunt petunia. \\n\\n“you could just leave me here,” harry put in hopefully \\n(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television \\nfor a change and maybe even have a go on dudley’s \\ncomputer) . \\n\\naunt petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a \\nlemon. \\n\\n“and come back and find the house in ruins?” she \\nsnarled. \\n\\n“i won’t blow up the house,” said harry, but they \\nweren’t listening. \\n\\n“i suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said aunt \\npetunia slowly, \"... and leave him in the car. ...” \\n\\n“that cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 25 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndudley began to cry loudly. in fact, he wasn’t really \\ncrying — it had been years since he’d really cried — \\nbut he knew that if he screwed up his face and \\nwailed, his mother would give him anything he \\nwanted. \\n\\n“dinky duddydums, don’t cry, mummy won’t let him \\nspoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms \\naround him. \\n\\n“i ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” dudley \\nyelled between huge, pretend sobs. “he always sp- \\nspoils everything!” he shot harry a nasty grin through \\nthe gap in his mothers arms. \\n\\njust then, the doorbell rang — “oh, good lord, \\nthey’re here!” said aunt petunia frantically — and a \\nmoment later, dudley’s best friend, piers polkiss, \\nwalked in with his mother. piers was a scrawny boy \\nwith a face like a rat. he was usually the one who \\nheld people’s arms behind their backs while dudley \\nhit them. dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \\n\\nhalf an hour later, harry, who couldn’t believe his \\nluck, was sitting in the back of the dursleys’ car with \\npiers and dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first \\ntime in his life. his aunt and uncle hadn’t been able \\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before \\nthey’d left, uncle vernon had taken harry aside. \\n\\n“i’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large \\npurple face right up close to harry’s, “i’m warning you \\nnow, boy — any funny business, anything at all — \\nand you’ll be in that cupboard from now until \\nchristmas.” \\n\\ni’m not going to do anything,” said harry, “honestly \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 26 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbut uncle vernon didn’t believe him. no one ever did. \\n\\n\\n\\nthe problem was, strange things often happened \\naround harry and it was just no good telling the \\ndursleys he didn’t make them happen. \\n\\nonce, aunt petunia, tired of harry coming back from \\nthe barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, \\nhad taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair \\nso short he was almost bald except for his bangs, \\nwhich she left “to hide that horrible scar.” dudley had \\nlaughed himself silly at harry, who spent a sleepless \\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was \\nalready laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped \\nglasses. next morning, however, he had gotten up to \\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before aunt \\npetunia had sheared it off. he had been given a week \\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to \\nexplain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown \\nback so quickly. \\n\\nanother time, aunt petunia had been trying to force \\nhim into a revolting old sweater of dudley’s (brown \\nwith orange puff balls). the harder she tried to pull it \\nover his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until \\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but \\ncertainly wouldn’t fit harry. aunt petunia had decided \\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great \\nrelief, harry wasn’t punished. \\n\\non the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble \\nfor being found on the roof of the school kitchens. \\ndudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, \\nas much to harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he \\nwas sitting on the chimney. the dursleys had \\nreceived a very angry letter from harry’s headmistress \\ntelling them harry had been climbing school \\nbuildings. but all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at \\nuncle vernon through the locked door of his \\npage | 27 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans \\noutside the kitchen doors. harry supposed that the \\nwind must have caught him in mid-jump. \\n\\nbut today, nothing was going to go wrong. it was even \\nworth being with dudley and piers to be spending the \\nday somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or \\nmrs. figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. \\n\\nwhile he drove, uncle vernon complained to aunt \\npetunia. he liked to complain about things: people at \\nwork, harry, the council, harry, the bank, and harry \\nwere just a few of his favorite subjects. this morning, \\nit was motorcycles. \\n\\n\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” \\nhe said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \\n\\n“i had a dream about a motorcycle,” said harry, \\nremembering suddenly. “it was flying.” \\n\\nuncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. he \\nturned right around in his seat and yelled at harry, \\nhis face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \\n“motorcycles dont fly!” \\n\\ndudley and piers sniggered. \\n\\n“i know they don’t,” said harry. “it was only a dream.” \\n\\nbut he wished he hadn’t said anything. if there was \\none thing the dursleys hated even more than his \\nasking questions, it was his talking about anything \\nacting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a \\ndream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he \\nmight get dangerous ideas. \\n\\nit was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was \\ncrowded with families. the dursleys bought dudley \\n\\npage | 28 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance \\nand then, because the smiling lady in the van had \\nasked harry what he wanted before they could hurry \\nhim away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. it \\nwasn’t bad, either, harry thought, licking it as they \\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked \\nremarkably like dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. \\n\\nharry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. \\nhe was careful to walk a little way apart from the \\ndursleys so that dudley and piers, who were starting \\nto get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t \\nfall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. they \\nate in the zoo restaurant, and when dudley had a \\ntantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have \\nenough ice cream on top, uncle vernon bought him \\nanother one and harry was allowed to finish the first. \\n\\nharry felt, afterward, that he should have known it \\nwas all too good to last. \\n\\nafter lunch they went to the reptile house. it was cool \\nand dark in there, with lit windows all along the \\nwalls. behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes \\nwere crawling and slithering over bits of wood and \\nstone. dudley and piers wanted to see huge, \\npoisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. \\ndudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. it \\ncould have wrapped its body twice around uncle \\nvernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at \\nthe moment it didn’t look in the mood. in fact, it was \\nfast asleep. \\n\\ndudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, \\nstaring at the glistening brown coils. \\n\\n“make it move,” he whined at his father. uncle vernon \\ntapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 29 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“do it again,” dudley ordered. uncle vernon rapped \\nthe glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake \\njust snoozed on. \\n\\n“this is boring,” dudley moaned. he shuffled away. \\n\\nharry moved in front of the tank and looked intently \\nat the snake. he wouldn’t have been surprised if it \\nhad died of boredom itself — no company except \\nstupid people drumming their fingers on the glass \\ntrying to disturb it all day long. it was worse than \\nhaving a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only \\nvisitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to \\nwake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the \\nhouse. \\n\\nthe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. slowly, \\nvery slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a \\nlevel with harry’s. \\n\\nit winked. \\n\\nharry stared. then he looked quickly around to see if \\nanyone was watching. they weren’t. he looked back \\nat the snake and winked, too. \\n\\nthe snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and \\ndudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. it gave \\nharry a look that said quite plainly: \\n\\n“i get that all the time.” \\n\\n“i know,” harry murmured through the glass, though \\nhe wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “it must be \\nreally annoying.” \\n\\nthe snake nodded vigorously. \\n\\n“where do you come from, anyway?” harry asked. \\n\\npage | 30 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the \\nglass. harry peered at it. \\n\\nboa constrictor, brazil. \\n\\n“was it nice there?” \\n\\nthe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again \\nand harry read on: this specimen was bred in the \\nzoo. “oh, i see — so you’ve never been to brazil?” \\n\\nas the snake shook its head, a deafening shout \\nbehind harry made both of them jump. “dudley! \\nmr. dursley! come and look at this snake! \\nyou wont believe what it’s doing!” \\n\\ndudley came waddling toward them as fast as he \\ncould. \\n\\n“out of the way, you,” he said, punching harry in the \\nribs. caught by surprise, harry fell hard on the \\nconcrete floor. what came next happened so fast no \\none saw how it happened — one second, piers and \\ndudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the \\nnext, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \\n\\nharry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa \\nconstrictor’s tank had vanished. the great snake was \\nuncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. \\npeople throughout the reptile house screamed and \\nstarted running for the exits. \\n\\nas the snake slid swiftly past him, harry could have \\nsworn a low, hissing voice said, “brazil, here i come. \\n... thanksss, amigo.” \\n\\nthe keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 31 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“but the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass \\ngo?” \" \\n\\nthe zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of \\nstrong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over \\nagain. piers and dudley could only gibber. as far as \\nharry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything \\nexcept snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but \\nby the time they were all back in uncle vernon’s car, \\ndudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off \\nhis leg, while piers was swearing it had tried to \\nsqueeze him to death. but worst of all, for harry at \\nleast, was piers calming down enough to say, “harry \\nwas talking to it, weren’t you, harry?” \\n\\nuncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the \\nhouse before starting on harry. he was so angry he \\ncould hardly speak. he managed to say, “go — \\ncupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed \\ninto a chair, and aunt petunia had to run and get \\nhim a large brandy. \\n\\nharry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing \\nhe had a watch. he didn’t know what time it was and \\nhe couldn’t be sure the dursleys were asleep yet. \\n\\nuntil they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the \\nkitchen for some food. \\n\\nhe’d lived with the dursleys almost ten years, ten \\nmiserable years, as long as he could remember, ever \\nsince he’d been a baby and his parents had died in \\nthat car crash. he couldn’t remember being in the car \\nwhen his parents had died. sometimes, when he \\nstrained his memory during long hours in his \\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a \\nblinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his \\nforehead. this, he supposed, was the crash, though \\nhe couldn’t imagine where all the green light came \\nfrom. he couldn’t remember his parents at all. his \\npage | 32 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of \\ncourse he was forbidden to ask questions. there were \\nno photographs of them in the house. \\n\\nwhen he had been younger, harry had dreamed and \\ndreamed of some unknown relation coming to take \\nhim away, but it had never happened; the dursleys \\nwere his only family. yet sometimes he thought (or \\nmaybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to \\nknow him. very strange strangers they were, too. a \\ntiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once \\nwhile out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley. \\nafter asking harry furiously if he knew the man, aunt \\npetunia had rushed them out of the shop without \\nbuying anything. a wild-looking old woman dressed \\nall in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. \\n\\na bald man in a very long purple coat had actually \\nshaken his hand in the street the other day and then \\nwalked away without a word. the weirdest thing \\nabout all these people was the way they seemed to \\nvanish the second harry tried to get a closer look. \\n\\nat school, harry had no one. everybody knew that \\ndudley’s gang hated that odd harry potter in his \\nbaggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody \\nliked to disagree with dudley’s gang. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 33 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe letters from no one \\n\\nthe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned \\nharry his longest-ever punishment. by the time he \\nwas allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer \\nholidays had started and dudley had already broken \\nhis new video camera, crashed his remote control \\nairplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, \\nknocked down old mrs. figg as she crossed privet \\ndrive on her crutches. \\n\\nharry was glad school was over, but there was no \\nescaping dudley’s gang, who visited the house every \\nsingle day. piers, dennis, malcolm, and gordon were \\nall big and stupid, but as dudley was the biggest and \\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. the rest of \\nthem were all quite happy to join in dudley’s favorite \\nsport: harry hunting. \\n\\nthis was why harry spent as much time as possible \\nout of the house, wandering around and thinking \\nabout the end of the holidays, where he could see a \\ntiny ray of hope. when september came he would be \\ngoing off to secondary school and, for the first time in \\npage | 34 \\n\\n\\n\\nhis life, he wouldn’t be with dudley. dudley had been \\naccepted at uncle vernon’s old private school, \\nsmeltings. piers polkiss was going there too. harry, \\non the other hand, was going to stonewall high, the \\nlocal public school. dudley thought this was very \\nfunny. \\n\\n“they stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day \\nat stonewall,” he told harry. “want to come upstairs \\nand practice?” \\n\\n“no, thanks,” said harry. “the poor toilet’s never had \\nanything as horrible as your head down it — it might \\nbe sick.” then he ran, before dudley could work out \\nwhat he’d said. \\n\\none day in july, aunt petunia took dudley to london \\nto buy his smeltings uniform, leaving harry at mrs. \\nfigg’s. mrs. figg wasn’t as bad as usual. it turned out \\nshe’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and \\nshe didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. she \\nlet harry watch television and gave him a bit of \\nchocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for \\nseveral years. \\n\\nthat evening, dudley paraded around the living room \\nfor the family in his brand-new uniform. smeltings \\nboys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, \\nand flat straw hats called boaters. they also carried \\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the \\nteachers weren’t looking. this was supposed to be \\ngood training for later life. \\n\\nas he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers, \\nuncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest \\nmoment of his life. aunt petunia burst into tears and \\nsaid she couldn’t believe it was her ickle dudleykins, \\nhe looked so handsome and grown-up. harry didn’t \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 35 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrust himself to speak. he thought two of his ribs \\nmight already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \\n\\n\\n\\nk k k \\n\\n\\n\\nthere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next \\nmorning when harry went in for breakfast. it seemed \\nto be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. he \\nwent to have a look. the tub was full of what looked \\nlike dirty rags swimming in gray water. \\n\\n“what’s this?” he asked aunt petunia. her lips \\ntightened as they always did if he dared to ask a \\nquestion. \\n\\n“your new school uniform,” she said. \\n\\nharry looked in the bowl again. \\n\\n“oh,” he said, “i didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” \\n\\n“don’t be stupid,” snapped aunt petunia. “i’m dyeing \\nsome of dudley’s old things gray for you. it’ll look just \\nlike everyone else’s when i’ve finished.” \\n\\nharry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not \\nto argue. he sat down at the table and tried not to \\nthink about how he was going to look on his first day \\nat stonewall high — like he was wearing bits of old \\nelephant skin, probably. \\n\\ndudley and uncle vernon came in, both with \\nwrinkled noses because of the smell from harry’s new \\nuniform. uncle vernon opened his newspaper as \\nusual and dudley banged his smelting stick, which \\nhe carried everywhere, on the table. \\n\\nthey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters \\non the doormat. \\n\\npage | 36 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“get the mail, dudley,” said uncle vernon from \\nbehind his paper. \\n\\n“make harry get it.” \\n\\n“get the mail, harry.” \\n\\n“make dudley get it.” \\n\\n“poke him with your smelting stick, dudley.” \\n\\nharry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the \\nmail. three things lay on the doormat: a postcard \\nfrom uncle vernon’s sister marge, who was \\nvacationing on the isle of wight, a brown envelope \\nthat looked like a bill, and — a letter for harry. \\n\\nharry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging \\nlike a giant elastic band. no one, ever, in his whole \\nlife, had written to him. who would? he had no \\nfriends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the \\nlibrary, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for \\nbooks back. yet here it was, a letter, addressed so \\nplainly there could be no mistake: \\n\\nmr. h. potter \\n\\nthe cupboard under the stairs \\n4 privet drive \\nlittle whinging \\nsurrey \\n\\nthe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish \\nparchment, and the address was written in emerald- \\ngreen ink. there was no stamp. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 37 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nturning the envelope over, his hand trembling, harry \\nsaw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, \\nan eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large \\nletter h. \\n\\n“hurry up, boy!” shouted uncle vernon from the \\nkitchen. “what are you doing, checking for letter \\nbombs?” he chuckled at his own joke. \\n\\nharry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his \\nletter. he handed uncle vernon the bill and the \\npostcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the \\nyellow envelope. \\n\\nuncle vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, \\nand flipped over the postcard. \\n\\n“marge’s ill,” he informed aunt petunia. “ate a funny \\nwhelk ...” \\n\\n“dad!” said dudley suddenly. “dad, harry’s got \\nsomething!” \\n\\nharry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which \\nwas written on the same heavy parchment as the \\nenvelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand \\nby uncle vernon. \\n\\n“that’s mine\\\\” said harry, trying to snatch it back. \\n\\n“who’d be writing to you?” sneered uncle vernon, \\nshaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at \\nit. his face went from red to green faster than a set of \\ntraffic lights. and it didn’t stop there. within seconds \\nit was the grayish white of old porridge. \\n\\n“p-p-petunia!” he gasped. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 38 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but uncle \\nvernon held it high out of his reach. aunt petunia \\ntook it curiously and read the first line. for a moment \\nit looked as though she might faint. she clutched her \\nthroat and made a choking noise. \\n\\n“vernon! oh my goodness — vernon!” \\n\\nthey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten \\nthat harry and dudley were still in the room. dudley \\nwasn’t used to being ignored. he gave his father a \\nsharp tap on the head with his smelting stick. \\n\\n“i want to read that letter,” he said loudly. \\n\\n“i want to read it,” said harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” \\n\\n“get out, both of you,” croaked uncle vernon, stuffing \\nthe letter back inside its envelope. \\n\\nharry didn’t move. \\n\\n“i want my letter!” he shouted. \\n\\n“let me see it!” demanded dudley. \\n\\n“out!” roared uncle vernon, and he took both harry \\nand dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw \\nthem into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind \\nthem. harry and dudley promptly had a furious but \\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; \\ndudley won, so harry, his glasses dangling from one \\near, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack \\nbetween door and floor. \\n\\n“vernon,” aunt petunia was saying in a quivering \\nvoice, “look at the address — how could they possibly \\nknow where he sleeps? you don’t think they’re \\nwatching the house?” \\n\\npage | 39 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“watching — spying — might be following us,” \\nmuttered uncle vernon wildly. \\n\\n“but what should we do, vernon? should we write \\nback? tell them we don’t want — ” \\n\\nharry could see uncle vernon’s shiny black shoes \\npacing up and down the kitchen. \\n\\n“no,” he said finally. “no, we’ll ignore it. if they don’t \\nget an answer. ... yes, that’s best ... we won’t do \\nanything. ...” \\n\\n“but — ” \\n\\n“i’m not having one in the house, petunia! didn’t we \\nswear when we took him in we’d stamp out that \\ndangerous nonsense?” \\n\\nthat evening when he got back from work, uncle \\nvernon did something he’d never done before; he \\nvisited harry in his cupboard. \\n\\n“where’s my letter?” said harry, the moment uncle \\nvernon had squeezed through the door. “who’s \\nwriting to me?” \\n\\n“no one. it was addressed to you by mistake,” said \\nuncle vernon shortly. “i have burned it.” \\n\\n“it was not a mistake,” said harry angrily, “it had my \\ncupboard on it.” \\n\\n“silence!” yelled uncle vernon, and a couple of \\nspiders fell from the ceiling. he took a few deep \\nbreaths and then forced his face into a smile, which \\nlooked quite painful. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 40 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“er — yes, harry — about this cupboard. your aunt \\nand i have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit \\nbig for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved \\ninto dudley’s second bedroom.” \\n\\n“why?” said harry. \\n\\n“don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “take this \\nstuff upstairs, now.” \\n\\nthe dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for \\nuncle vernon and aunt petunia, one for visitors \\n(usually uncle vernon’s sister, marge), one where \\ndudley slept, and one where dudley kept all the toys \\nand things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. it \\nonly took harry one trip upstairs to move everything \\nhe owned from the cupboard to this room. he sat \\ndown on the bed and stared around him. nearly \\neverything in here was broken. the month-old video \\ncamera was lying on top of a small, working tank \\ndudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s \\ndog; in the corner was dudley’s first-ever television \\nset, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite \\nprogram had been canceled; there was a large \\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that dudley \\nhad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was \\nup on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley \\nhad sat on it. other shelves were full of books. they \\nwere the only things in the room that looked as \\nthough they’d never been touched. \\n\\nfrom downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling \\nat his mother, “i don’t want him in there ... i need \\nthat room ... make him get out. ...” \\n\\nharry sighed and stretched out on the bed. yesterday \\nhe’d have given anything to be up here. today he’d \\nrather be back in his cupboard with that letter than \\nup here without it. \\n\\npage | 41 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. \\ndudley was in shock. he’d screamed, whacked his \\nfather with his smelting stick, been sick on purpose, \\nkicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through \\nthe greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room \\nback. harry was thinking about this time yesterday \\nand bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. \\nuncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each \\nother darkly. \\n\\nwhen the mail arrived, uncle vernon, who seemed to \\nbe trying to be nice to harry, made dudley go and get \\nit. they heard him banging things with his smelting \\nstick all the way down the hall. then he shouted, \\n“there’s another one! ‘mr. h. potter, the smallest \\nbedroom, 4 privet drive — ’ ” \\n\\nwith a strangled cry, uncle vernon leapt from his \\nseat and ran down the hall, harry right behind him. \\nuncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to \\nget the letter from him, which was made difficult by \\nthe fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around \\nthe neck from behind. after a minute of confused \\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the \\nsmelting stick, uncle vernon straightened up, \\ngasping for breath, with harry’s letter clutched in his \\nhand. \\n\\n“go to your cupboard — i mean, your bedroom,” he \\nwheezed at harry. “dudley — go — just go.” \\n\\nharry walked round and round his new room. \\nsomeone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and \\nthey seemed to know he hadn’t received his first \\nletter. surely that meant they’d try again? and this \\ntime he’d make sure they didn’t fail. he had a plan. \\n\\nthe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next \\nmorning. harry turned it off quickly and dressed \\n\\npage | 42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsilently. he mustn’t wake the dursleys. he stole \\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights. \\n\\nhe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of \\nprivet drive and get the letters for number four first. \\nhis heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall \\ntoward the front door — \\n\\n“aaaaarrrgh ! ” \\n\\nharry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something \\nbig and squashy on the doormat — something alive\\\\ \\n\\nlights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry \\nrealized that the big, squashy something had been his \\nuncle’s face. uncle vernon had been lying at the foot \\nof the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making \\nsure that harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been \\ntrying to do. he shouted at harry for about half an \\nhour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. \\nharry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by \\nthe time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into \\nuncle vernon’s lap. harry could see three letters \\naddressed in green ink. \\n\\n“i want — ” he began, but uncle vernon was tearing \\nthe letters into pieces before his eyes. \\n\\nuncle vernon didn’t go to work that day. he stayed at \\nhome and nailed up the mail slot. \\n\\n“see,” he explained to aunt petunia through a \\nmouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll \\njust give up.” \\n\\n“i’m not sure that’ll work, vernon.” \\n\\n“oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, \\npetunia, they’re not like you and me,” said uncle \\n\\npage | 43 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of \\nfruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him. \\n\\non friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for \\nharry. as they couldn’t go through the mail slot they \\nhad been pushed under the door, slotted through the \\nsides, and a few even forced through the small \\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom. \\n\\nuncle vernon stayed at home again. after burning all \\nthe letters, he got out a hammer and nails and \\nboarded up the cracks around the front and back \\ndoors so no one could go out. he hummed “tiptoe \\nthrough the tulips” as he worked, and jumped at \\nsmall noises. \\n\\non saturday, things began to get out of hand. \\ntwenty-four letters to harry found their way into the \\nhouse, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two \\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had \\nhanded aunt petunia through the living room \\nwindow. while uncle vernon made furious telephone \\ncalls to the post office and the dairy trying to find \\nsomeone to complain to, aunt petunia shredded the \\nletters in her food processor. \\n\\n“who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” \\ndudley asked harry in amazement. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\non sunday morning, uncle vernon sat down at the \\nbreakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \\n\\n“no post on sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully \\nas he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no \\ndamn letters today — ” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 44 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney \\nas he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of \\nthe head. next moment, thirty or forty letters came \\npelting out of the fireplace like bullets. the dursleys \\nducked, but harry leapt into the air trying to catch \\none — \\n\\n“out! out!” \\n\\nuncle vernon seized harry around the waist and \\nthrew him into the hall. when aunt petunia and \\ndudley had run out with their arms over their faces, \\nuncle vernon slammed the door shut. they could \\nhear the letters still streaming into the room, \\nbouncing off the walls and floor. \\n\\n“that does it,” said uncle vernon, trying to speak \\ncalmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at \\nthe same time. “i want you all back here in five \\nminutes ready to leave. we’re going away. just pack \\nsome clothes. no arguments!” \\n\\nhe looked so dangerous with half his mustache \\nmissing that no one dared argue. ten minutes later \\nthey had wrenched their way through the boarded-up \\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the \\nhighway. dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his \\nfather had hit him round the head for holding them \\nup while he tried to pack his television, vcr, and \\ncomputer in his sports bag. \\n\\nthey drove. and they drove. even aunt petunia didn’t \\ndare ask where they were going. every now and then \\nuncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in \\nthe opposite direction for a while. \\n\\n“shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter \\nwhenever he did this. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 45 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. by nightfall \\ndudley was howling. he’d never had such a bad day \\nin his life. he was hungry, he’d missed five television \\nprograms he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so \\nlong without blowing up an alien on his computer. \\n\\nuncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- \\nlooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. dudley \\nand harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, \\nmusty sheets. dudley snored but harry stayed awake, \\nsitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of \\npassing cars and wondering... \\n\\nthey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on \\ntoast for breakfast the next day. they had just \\nfinished when the owner of the hotel came over to \\ntheir table. \\n\\n“ ’scuse me, but is one of you mr. h. potter? only i \\ngot about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” \\n\\nshe held up a letter so they could read the green ink \\naddress: \\n\\nmr. h. potter \\n\\nroom 1 7 \\n\\nrailview hotel \\n\\ncokeworth \\n\\nharry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon \\nknocked his hand out of the way. the woman stared. \\n\\n“i’ll take them,” said uncle vernon, standing up \\nquickly and following her from the dining room. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” aunt \\npetunia suggested timidly, hours later, but uncle \\nvernon didn’t seem to hear her. exactly what he was \\nlooking for, none of them knew. he drove them into \\nthe middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook \\nhis head, got back in the car, and off they went again. \\nthe same thing happened in the middle of a plowed \\nfield, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the \\ntop of a multilevel parking garage. \\n\\n“daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” dudley asked aunt \\npetunia dully late that afternoon. uncle vernon had \\nparked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, \\nand disappeared. \\n\\nit started to rain. great drops beat on the roof of the \\ncar. dudley sniveled. \\n\\n“it’s monday,” he told his mother. “the great \\nhumberto’s on tonight. i want to stay somewhere with \\na television.” \\n\\nmonday. this reminded harry of something. if it was \\nmonday — and you could usually count on dudley to \\nknow the days of the week, because of television — \\nthen tomorrow, tuesday, was harry’s eleventh \\nbirthday. of course, his birthdays were never exactly \\nfun — last year, the dursleys had given him a coat \\nhanger and a pair of uncle vernon’s old socks. still, \\nyou weren’t eleven every day. \\n\\nuncle vernon was back and he was smiling. he was \\nalso carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer \\naunt petunia when she asked what he’d bought. \\n\\n“found the perfect place!” he said. “come on! \\n\\neveryone out!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 47 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was very cold outside the car. uncle vernon was \\npointing at what looked like a large rock way out at \\nsea. perched on top of the rock was the most \\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. one thing \\nwas certain, there was no television in there. \\n\\n“storm forecast for tonight!” said uncle vernon \\ngleefully, clapping his hands together. “and this \\ngentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” \\n\\na toothless old man came ambling up to them, \\npointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat \\nbobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \\n\\n“i’ve already got us some rations,” said uncle vernon, \\n“so all aboard!” \\n\\nit was freezing in the boat. icy sea spray and rain \\ncrept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped \\ntheir faces. after what seemed like hours they \\nreached the rock, where uncle vernon, slipping and \\nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \\n\\nthe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of \\nseaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the \\nwooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. \\nthere were only two rooms. \\n\\nuncle vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips \\neach and four bananas. he tried to start a fire but the \\nempty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \\n\\n“could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said \\ncheerfully. \\n\\nhe was in a very good mood. obviously he thought \\nnobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a \\nstorm to deliver mail. harry privately agreed, though \\nthe thought didn’t cheer him up at all. \\n\\npage | 48 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nas night fell, the promised storm blew up around \\nthem. spray from the high waves splattered the walls \\nof the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy \\nwindows. aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in \\nthe second room and made up a bed for dudley on \\nthe moth-eaten sofa. she and uncle vernon went off \\nto the lumpy bed next door, and harry was left to find \\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under \\nthe thinnest, most ragged blanket. \\n\\nthe storm raged more and more ferociously as the \\nnight went on. harry couldn’t sleep. he shivered and \\nturned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach \\nrumbling with hunger. dudley’s snores were drowned \\nby the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. \\nthe lighted dial of dudley’s watch, which was \\ndangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told \\nharry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. he lay and \\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the \\ndursleys would remember at all, wondering where the \\nletter writer was now. \\n\\nfive minutes to go. harry heard something creak \\noutside. he hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, \\nalthough he might be warmer if it did. four minutes \\nto go. maybe the house in privet drive would be so \\nfull of letters when they got back that he’d be able to \\nsteal one somehow. \\n\\nthree minutes to go. was that the sea, slapping hard \\non the rock like that? and (two minutes to go) what \\nwas that funny crunching noise? was the rock \\ncrumbling into the sea? \\n\\none minute to go and he’d be eleven. thirty seconds \\n... twenty ... ten ... nine — maybe he’d wake dudley \\nup, just to annoy him — three ... two ... one ... \\n\\nboom. \\n\\npage | 49 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright, \\nstaring at the door. someone was outside, knocking \\nto come in. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 50 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe keeper of the keys \\n\\nboom. they knocked again. dudley jerked awake. \\n\\n“where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. \\n\\nthere was a crash behind them and uncle vernon \\ncame skidding into the room. he was holding a rifle in \\nhis hands — now they knew what had been in the \\nlong, thin package he had brought with them. \\n\\n“who’s there?” he shouted. “i warn you — i’m armed!” \\n\\nthere was a pause. then — \\n\\nsmash! \\n\\nthe door was hit with such force that it swung clean \\noff its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat \\non the floor. \\n\\na giant of a man was standing in the doorway. his \\nface was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy \\nmane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could \\n\\npage | 51 \\n\\n\\n\\nmake out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under \\nall the hair. \\n\\nthe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so \\nthat his head just brushed the ceiling. he bent down, \\npicked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its \\nframe. the noise of the storm outside dropped a little. \\nhe turned to look at them all. \\n\\n“couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? it’s not \\nbeen an easy journey. ...” \\n\\nhe strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen \\nwith fear. \\n\\n“budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. \\n\\ndudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, \\nwho was crouching, terrified, behind uncle vernon. \\n\\n“an’ here’s harry!” said the giant. \\n\\nharry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face \\nand saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \\n\\n“las’ time i saw you, you was only a baby,” said the \\ngiant. “yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer \\nmom’s eyes.” \\n\\nuncle vernon made a funny rasping noise. \\n\\n“i demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “you \\nare breaking and entering!” \\n\\n“ah, shut up, dursley, yeh great prune,” said the \\ngiant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the \\ngun out of uncle vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot \\nas easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw \\nit into a corner of the room. \\n\\npage | 52 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuncle vernon made another funny noise, like a \\nmouse being trodden on. \\n\\n“anyway — harry,” said the giant, turning his back \\non the dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. got \\nsummat fer yeh here — i mighta sat on it at some \\npoint, but it’ll taste all right.” \\n\\nfrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled \\na slightly squashed box. harry opened it with \\ntrembling fingers. inside was a large, sticky chocolate \\ncake with happy birthday harry written on it in green \\nicing. \\n\\nharry looked up at the giant. he meant to say thank \\nyou, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, \\nand what he said instead was, “who are you?” \\n\\nthe giant chuckled. \\n\\n“true, i haven’t introduced meself. rubeus hagrid, \\nkeeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts.” \\n\\nhe held out an enormous hand and shook harry’s \\nwhole arm. \\n\\n“what about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his \\nhands together. “i’d not say no ter summat stronger if \\nyeh’ve got it, mind.” \\n\\nhis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled \\nchip bags in it and he snorted. he bent down over the \\nfireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but \\nwhen he drew back a second later, there was a \\nroaring fire there. it filled the whole damp hut with \\nflickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over \\nhim as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 53 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged \\nunder his weight, and began taking all sorts of things \\nout of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a \\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, \\nseveral chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber \\nliquid that he took a swig from before starting to \\nmake tea. soon the hut was full of the sound and \\nsmell of sizzling sausage. nobody said a thing while \\nthe giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, \\njuicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, dudley \\nfidgeted a little. uncle vernon said sharply, “don’t \\ntouch anything he gives you, dudley.” \\n\\nthe giant chuckled darkly. \\n\\n“yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ \\nanymore, dursley, don’ worry.” \\n\\nhe passed the sausages to harry, who was so hungry \\nhe had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he \\nstill couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. finally, as \\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \\n“i’m sorry, but i still don’t really know who you are.” \\n\\nthe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with \\nthe back of his hand. \\n\\n“call me hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. an’ like i \\ntold yeh, i’m keeper of keys at hogwarts — yeh’ll \\nknow all about hogwarts, o’ course.” \\n\\n“er — no,” said harry. \\n\\nhagrid looked shocked. \\n\\n“sorry,” harry said quickly. \\n\\n“sorry?” barked hagrid, turning to stare at the \\ndursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “it’s \\n\\npage | 54 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthem as should be sorry! i knew yeh weren’t gettin’ \\nyer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn’t even \\nknow abou’ hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! did yeh \\nnever wonder where yer parents learned it all?” \\n\\n“all what?” asked harry. \\n\\n“all what?” hagrid thundered. “now wait jus’ one \\nsecond!” \\n\\nhe had leapt to his feet. in his anger he seemed to fill \\nthe whole hut. the dursleys were cowering against \\nthe wall. \\n\\n“do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the dursleys, \\n“that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — \\nabout anything?” \\n\\nharry thought this was going a bit far. he had been to \\nschool, after all, and his marks weren’t bad. \\n\\n“i know some things,” he said. “i can, you know, do \\nmath and stuff.” \\n\\nbut hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “about \\nour world, i mean. your world. my world. yer parents’ \\nworld.” \\n\\n“what world?” \\n\\nhagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \\n“dursley!” he boomed. \\n\\nuncle vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered \\nsomething that sounded like “mimblewimble.” hagrid \\nstared wildly at harry. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 55 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“but yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he \\nsaid. “i mean, they’re famous. you’re famous.” \\n\\n“what? my — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were \\nthey?” \\n\\n“yeh don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” hagrid ran his \\nfingers through his hair, fixing harry with a \\nbewildered stare. \\n\\n“yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally. \\n\\nuncle vernon suddenly found his voice. \\n\\n“stop!” he commanded. “stop right there, sir! i forbid \\nyou to tell the boy anything!” \\n\\na braver man than vernon dursley would have \\nquailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him; \\nwhen hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with \\nrage. \\n\\n“you never told him? never told him what was in the \\nletter dumbledore left fer him? i was there! i saw \\ndumbledore leave it, dursley! an’ you’ve kept it from \\nhim all these years?” \\n\\n“kept what from me?” said harry eagerly. \\n\\n“stop! i forbid you!” yelled uncle vernon in panic. \\n\\naunt petunia gave a gasp of horror. \\n\\n“ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said hagrid. \\n“harry — yer a wizard.” \\n\\nthere was silence inside the hut. only the sea and \\nthe whistling wind could be heard. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 56 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i’m a what?” gasped harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n“a wizard, o’ course,” said hagrid, sitting back down \\non the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ \\na thumpin’ good’un, i’d say, once yeh’ve been trained \\nup a bit. with a mum an’ dad like yours, what else \\nwould yeh be? an’ i reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read \\nyer letter.” \\n\\nharry stretched out his hand at last to take the \\nyellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to mr. \\nh. potter, the floor, hut-on-the-rock, the sea. he \\npulled out the letter and read: \\n\\nhogwarts school \\no/witchcraft and wizardry \\n\\nheadmaster: albus dumbledore \\n\\n(order of merlin, first class, grand sore., chf. \\n\\nwarlock, supreme mugwump, international confed. of \\nwizards) \\n\\ndear mr. potter, \\n\\nwe are pleased to inform you that you have been \\naccepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and \\nwizardry. please find enclosed a list of all necessary \\nbooks and equipment. \\n\\nterm begins on september 1. we await your owl by no \\nlater than july 31. \\n\\nyours sincerely, \\n\\nminerva mcgonagall, \\n\\ndeputy headmistress \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 57 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquestions exploded inside harry’s head like fireworks \\nand he couldn’t decide which to ask first. after a few \\nminutes he stammered, “what does it mean, they \\nawait my owl?” \\n\\n“gallopin’ gorgons, that reminds me,” said hagrid, \\nclapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to \\nknock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket \\ninside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, \\nrather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of \\nparchment. with his tongue between his teeth he \\nscribbled a note that harry could read upside down: \\n\\ndear professor dumbledore, \\n\\ngiven harry his letter. \\n\\ntaking him to buy his things tomorrow. \\n\\nweather’s horrible. hope you’re well. \\n\\nhagrid \\n\\nhagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which \\nclamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw \\nthe owl out into the storm. then he came back and \\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on \\nthe telephone. \\n\\nharry realized his mouth was open and closed it \\nquickly. \\n\\n“where was i?” said hagrid, but at that moment, \\n\\nuncle vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very \\nangry, moved into the firelight. \\n\\n“he’s not going,” he said. \\n\\nhagrid grunted. \\n\\npage | 58 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i’d like ter see a great muggle like you stop him,” he \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\n\\n“a what?” said harry, interested. \\n\\n“a muggle,” said hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic \\nfolk like them. an’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a \\nfamily o’ the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on.” \\n\\n“we swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to \\nthat rubbish,” said uncle vernon, “swore we’d stamp \\nit out of him! wizard indeed!” \\n\\n“you knew?” said harry. “you knew i’m a — a \\nwizard?” \\n\\n“knew!” shrieked aunt petunia suddenly. “knew\\\\ of \\ncourse we knew! how could you not be, my dratted \\nsister being what she was? oh, she got a letter just \\nlike that and disappeared off to that — that school — \\nand came home every vacation with her pockets full \\nof frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. i was the \\nonly one who saw her for what she was — a freak! \\n\\nbut for my mother and father, oh no, it was lily this \\nand lily that, they were proud of having a witch in \\nthe family!” \\n\\nshe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went \\nranting on. it seemed she had been wanting to say all \\nthis for years. \\n\\n“then she met that potter at school and they left and \\ngot married and had you, and of course i knew you’d \\nbe just the same, just as strange, just as — as — \\nabnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got \\nherself blown up and we got landed with you!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry had gone very white. as soon as he found his \\nvoice he said, “blown up? you told me they died in a \\ncar crash!” \\n\\n“car crash!” roared hagrid, jumping up so angrily \\nthat the dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “how \\ncould a car crash kill lily an’ james potter? it’s an \\noutrage! a scandal! harry potter not knowin’ his own \\nstory when every kid in our world knows his name!” \\n\\n“but why? what happened?” harry asked urgently. \\n\\nthe anger faded from hagrid’s face. he looked \\nsuddenly anxious. \\n\\n“i never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried \\nvoice. “i had no idea, when dumbledore told me there \\nmight be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh \\ndidn’t know. ah, harry, i don’ know if i’m the right \\nperson ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t \\ngo off ter hogwarts not knowin’.” \\n\\nhe threw a dirty look at the dursleys. \\n\\n“well, it’s best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh — \\nmind, i can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, \\nparts of it. ...” \\n\\nhe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, \\nand then said, “it begins, i suppose, with — with a \\nperson called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his \\nname, everyone in our world knows — ” \\n\\n“who?” \\n\\n“well — i don’ like sayin’ the name if i can help it. no \\none does.” \\n\\n“why not?” \\n\\npage | 60 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“gulpin’ gargoyles, harry, people are still scared. \\nblimey, this is difficult. see, there was this wizard \\nwho went ... bad. as bad as you could go. worse. \\nworse than worse. his name was ...” \\n\\nhagrid gulped, but no words came out. \\n\\n“could you write it down?” harry suggested. \\n\\n“nah — can’t spell it. all right — voldemort.” hagrid \\nshuddered. “don’ make me say it again. anyway, this \\n— this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started \\nlookin’ fer followers. got ’em, too — some were afraid, \\nsome just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was \\ngettin’ himself power, all right. dark days, harry. \\ndidn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly \\nwith strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things \\nhappened. he was takin’ over. ’course, some stood up \\nto him — an’ he killed ’em. horribly. one o’ the only \\nsafe places left was hogwarts. reckon dumbledore’s \\nthe only one you-know-who was afraid of. didn’t dare \\ntry takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. \\n\\n“now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ \\nwizard as i ever knew. head boy an’ girl at hogwarts \\nin their day! suppose the myst’ry is why you-know- \\nwho never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . \\nprobably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter \\nwant anythin’ ter do with the dark side. \\n\\n“maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ... maybe \\nhe just wanted ’em outta the way. all anyone knows \\nis, he turned up in the village where you was all \\nliving, on halloween ten years ago. you was just a \\nyear old. he came ter yer house an’ — an’ — ” \\n\\nhagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted \\nhandkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a \\nfoghorn. \\n\\npage | 61 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“sorry,” he said. “but it’s that sad — knew yer mum \\nan’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway \\n\\n\\n\\n“you-know-who killed ’em. an’ then — an’ this is the \\nreal myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. \\nwanted ter make a clean job of it, i suppose, or \\nmaybe he just liked killin’ by then. but he couldn’t do \\nit. never wondered how you got that mark on yer \\nforehead? that was no ordinary cut. that’s what yeh \\nget when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took \\ncare of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it \\ndidn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, harry. \\nno one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one \\nexcept you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches \\nan’ wizards of the age — the mckinnons, the bones, \\nthe prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you \\nlived.” \\n\\nsomething very painful was going on in harry’s mind. \\nas hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the \\nblinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had \\never remembered it before — and he remembered \\nsomething else, for the first time in his life: a high, \\ncold, cruel laugh. \\n\\nhagrid was watching him sadly. \\n\\n“took yeh from the ruined house myself, on \\ndumbledore’s orders. brought yeh ter this lot ...” \\n\\n“load of old tosh,” said uncle vernon. harry jumped; \\nhe had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there. \\nuncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his \\ncourage. he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were \\nclenched. \\n\\n“now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “i accept \\nthere’s something strange about you, probably \\n\\npage | 62 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as \\nfor all this about your parents, well, they were \\nweirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off \\nwithout them in my opinion — asked for all they got, \\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types — just \\nwhat i expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky \\nend — ” \\n\\nbut at that moment, hagrid leapt from the sofa and \\ndrew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. \\npointing this at uncle vernon like a sword, he said, \\n“i’m warning you, dursley — i’m warning you — one \\nmore word ...” \\n\\nin danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella \\nby a bearded giant, uncle vernon’s courage failed \\nagain; he flattened himself against the wall and fell \\nsilent. \\n\\n“that’s better,” said hagrid, breathing heavily and \\nsitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged \\nright down to the floor. \\n\\nharry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, \\nhundreds of them. \\n\\n“but what happened to vol-, sorry — i mean, you- \\nknow-who?” \\n\\n“good question, harry. disappeared. vanished. same \\nnight he tried ter kill you. makes yeh even more \\nfamous. that’s the biggest myst’ry, see ... he was \\ngettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go? \\n\\n“some say he died. codswallop, in my opinion. dunno \\nif he had enough human left in him to die. some say \\nhe’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but i don’ \\nbelieve it. people who was on his side came back ter \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 63 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nours. some of ’em came outta kinda trances. don’ \\nreckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back. \\n\\n“most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but \\nlost his powers. too weak to carry on. ’cause \\nsomethin’ about you finished him, harry. there was \\nsomethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — \\n/ dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ \\nabout you stumped him, all right.” \\n\\nhagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect \\nblazing in his eyes, but harry, instead of feeling \\npleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a \\nhorrible mistake. a wizard? him? how could he \\npossibly be? he’d spent his life being clouted by \\ndudley, and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle \\nvernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they \\nbeen turned into warty toads every time they’d tried \\nto lock him in his cupboard? if he’d once defeated the \\ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come dudley had \\nalways been able to kick him around like a football? \\n\\n“hagrid,” he said quietly, “i think you must have \\nmade a mistake. i don’t think i can be a wizard.” \\n\\nto his surprise, hagrid chuckled. \\n\\n“not a wizard, eh? never made things happen when \\nyou was scared or angry?” \\n\\nharry looked into the fire. now he came to think \\nabout it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his \\naunt and uncle furious with him had happened when \\nhe, harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by \\ndudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of \\ntheir reach . . . dreading going to school with that \\nridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow \\nback . . . and the very last time dudley had hit him, \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 64 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he \\nwas doing it? hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? \\n\\n\\n\\nharry looked back at hagrid, smiling, and saw that \\nhagrid was positively beaming at him. \\n\\n“see?” said hagrid. “harry potter, not a wizard — you \\nwait, you’ll be right famous at hogwarts.” \\n\\nbut uncle vernon wasn’t going to give in without a \\nfight. \\n\\n“haven’t i told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “he’s \\ngoing to stonewall high and he’ll be grateful for it. i’ve \\nread those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — \\nspell books and wands and — ” \\n\\n“if he wants ter go, a great muggle like you won’t stop \\nhim,” growled hagrid. “stop lily an’ james potter’s \\nson goin’ ter hogwarts! yer mad. his name’s been \\ndown ever since he was born. he’s off ter the finest \\nschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. seven \\nyears there and he won’t know himself. he’ll be with \\nyoungsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be \\nunder the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had, \\nalbus dumbled — ” \\n\\n“i am not paying for some crackpot old \\nfool to teach him magic tricks!” yelled uncle \\nvernon. \\n\\nbut he had finally gone too far. hagrid seized his \\numbrella and whirled it over his head, “never — ” he \\nthundered, “— insult — albus — dumbledore \\n— in — front — of — me!” \\n\\nhe brought the umbrella swishing down through the \\nair to point at dudley — there was a flash of violet \\nlight, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and \\n\\npage | 65 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe next second, dudley was dancing on the spot with \\nhis hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in \\npain. when he turned his back on them, harry saw a \\ncurly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. \\n\\nuncle vernon roared. pulling aunt petunia and \\ndudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified \\nlook at hagrid and slammed the door behind them. \\n\\nhagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his \\nbeard. \\n\\n“shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it \\ndidn’t work anyway. meant ter turn him into a pig, \\nbut i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there \\nwasn’t much left ter do.” \\n\\nhe cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy \\neyebrows. \\n\\n“be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at \\nhogwarts,” he said. “i’m — er — not supposed ter do \\nmagic, strictly speakin’. i was allowed ter do a bit ter \\nfollow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ \\nthe reasons i was so keen ter take on the job — ” \\n\\n“why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked harry. \\n\\n“oh, well — i was at hogwarts meself but i — er — \\ngot expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. in me third year. \\nthey snapped me wand in half an’ everything. but \\ndumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. great \\nman, dumbledore.” \\n\\n“why were you expelled?” \\n\\n“it’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” \\nsaid hagrid loudly. “gotta get up ter town, get all yer \\nbooks an’ that.” \\n\\npage | 66 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry. \\n\\n\\n\\n“you can kip under that,” he said. “don’ mind if it \\nwriggles a bit, i think i still got a couple o’ dormice in \\none o’ the pockets.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 67 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndiagon ally \\n\\nharry woke early the next morning. although he \\ncould tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \\n\\n“it was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “i dreamed a \\ngiant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a \\nschool for wizards. when i open my eyes i’ll be at \\nhome in my cupboard.” \\n\\nthere was suddenly a loud tapping noise. \\n\\nand there’s aunt petunia knocking on the door, harry \\nthought, his heart sinking. but he still didn’t open his \\neyes. it had been such a good dream. \\n\\ntap. tap. tap. \\n\\n“all right,” harry mumbled, “i’m getting up.” \\n\\nhe sat up and hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him. the \\nhut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, hagrid \\nhimself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 68 \\n\\n\\n\\nwas an owl rapping its claw on the window, a \\nnewspaper held in its beak. \\n\\nharry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as \\nthough a large balloon was swelling inside him. he \\nwent straight to the window and jerked it open. the \\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of \\nhagrid, who didn’t wake up. the owl then fluttered \\nonto the floor and began to attack hagrid ’s coat. \\n\\n“don’t do that.” \\n\\nharry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it \\nsnapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on \\nsavaging the coat. \\n\\n“hagrid!” said harry loudly. “there’s an owl — ” \\n\\n“pay him,” hagrid grunted into the sofa. \\n\\n“what?” \\n\\n“he wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. look in the \\npockets.” \\n\\nhagrid ’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but \\npockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of \\nstring, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, harry \\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \\n\\n“give him five knuts,” said hagrid sleepily. \\n\\n“knuts?” \\n\\n“the little bronze ones.” \\n\\nharry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl \\nheld out his leg so harry could put the money into a \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 69 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmall leather pouch tied to it. then he flew off \\nthrough the open window. \\n\\nhagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \\n\\n“best be off, harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter \\nlondon an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” \\n\\nharry was turning over the wizard coins and looking \\nat them. he had just thought of something that made \\nhim feel as though the happy balloon inside him had \\ngot a puncture. \\n\\n“urn — hagrid?” \\n\\n“mm?” said hagrid, who was pulling on his huge \\nboots. \\n\\n“i haven’t got any money — and you heard uncle \\nvernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go and \\nlearn magic.” \\n\\n“don’t worry about that,” said hagrid, standing up \\nand scratching his head. “d’yeh think yer parents \\ndidn’t leave yeh anything?” \\n\\n“but if their house was destroyed — ” \\n\\n“they didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! nah, \\nfirst stop fer us is gringotts. wizards’ bank. have a \\nsausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ i wouldn’ say no \\nteh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” \\n\\n“wizards have banks?” \\n\\n“just the one. gringotts. run by goblins.” \\n\\nharry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 70 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“goblins?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, i’ll tell yeh \\nthat. never mess with goblins, harry. gringotts is the \\nsafest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter \\nkeep safe — ’cept maybe hogwarts. as a matter o’ \\nfact, i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore. \\nhogwarts business.” hagrid drew himself up proudly. \\n“he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. \\nfetchin’ you — gettin’ things from gringotts — knows \\nhe can trust me, see. \\n\\n“got everythin’? come on, then.” \\n\\nharry followed hagrid out onto the rock. the sky was \\nquite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. \\nthe boat uncle vernon had hired was still there, with \\na lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \\n\\n“how did you get here?” harry asked, looking around \\nfor another boat. \\n\\n“flew,” said hagrid. \\n\\n“flew?” \\n\\n“yeah — but we’ll go back in this. not s’pposed ter \\nuse magic now i’ve got yeh.” \\n\\nthey settled down in the boat, harry still staring at \\nhagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \\n\\n“seems a shame ter row, though,” said hagrid, giving \\nharry another of his sideways looks. “if i was ter — er \\n— speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not \\nmentionin’ it at hogwarts?” \\n\\n“of course not,” said harry, eager to see more magic. \\nhagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it \\n\\npage | 71 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward \\nland. \\n\\n“why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts?” \\nharry asked. \\n\\n“spells — enchantments,” said hagrid, unfolding his \\nnewspaper as he spoke. “they say there’s dragons \\nguardin’ the high-security vaults. and then yeh gotta \\nfind yer way — gringotts is hundreds of miles under \\nlondon, see. deep under the underground. yeh’d die \\nof hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter \\nget yer hands on summat.” \\n\\nharry sat and thought about this while hagrid read \\nhis newspaper, the daily prophet harry had learned \\nfrom uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone \\nwhile they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d \\nnever had so many questions in his life. \\n\\n“ministry o’ magic messin’ things up as usual,” hagrid \\nmuttered, turning the page. \\n\\n“there’s a ministry of magic?” harry asked, before he \\ncould stop himself. \\n\\n“ ’course,” said hagrid. “they wanted dumbledore fer \\nminister, o’ course, but he’d never leave hogwarts, so \\nold cornelius fudge got the job. bungler if ever there \\nwas one. so he pelts dumbledore with owls every \\nmorning, askin’ fer advice.” \\n\\n“but what does a ministry of magic do?” \\n\\n“well, their main job is to keep it from the muggles \\nthat there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the \\ncountry.” \\n\\n“why?” \\n\\npage | 72 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“why? blimey, harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic \\nsolutions to their problems. nah, we’re best left \\nalone.” \\n\\nat this moment the boat bumped gently into the \\nharbor wall. hagrid folded up his newspaper, and \\nthey clambered up the stone steps onto the street. \\n\\npassersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked \\nthrough the little town to the station. harry couldn’t \\nblame them. not only was hagrid twice as tall as \\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary \\nthings like parking meters and saying loudly, “see \\nthat, harry? things these muggles dream up, eh?” \\n\\n“hagrid,” said harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep \\nup, “did you say there are dragons at gringotts?” \\n\\n“well, so they say,” said hagrid. “crikey, i’d like a \\ndragon.” \\n\\n“you’d like one?” \\n\\n“wanted one ever since i was a kid — here we go.” \\n\\nthey had reached the station. there was a train to \\nlondon in five minutes’ time. hagrid, who didn’t \\nunderstand “muggle money,” as he called it, gave the \\nbills to harry so he could buy their tickets. \\n\\npeople stared more than ever on the train. hagrid \\ntook up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a \\ncanary-yellow circus tent. \\n\\n“still got yer letter, harry?” he asked as he counted \\nstitches. \\n\\nharry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 73 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“good,” said hagrid. “there’s a list there of everything \\nyeh need.” \\n\\n\\n\\nharry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t \\nnoticed the night before, and read: \\n\\nhogwarts school \\no/witchcraft and wizardry \\n\\nuniform \\n\\n\\n\\nfirst-year students will require: \\n\\n1 . three sets of plain work robes (black) \\n\\n2. one plain pointed hat (black) for day wear \\n\\n3. one pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or \\nsimilar) \\n\\n4. one winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) \\n\\nplease note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name \\ntags \\n\\n\\n\\ncourse books \\n\\n\\n\\nall students should have a

first years are \\nnot allowed their own broomsticks \\n\\n“can we buy all this in london?” harry wondered \\naloud. \\n\\n“if yeh know where to go,” said hagrid. \\n\\nharry had never been to london before. although \\nhagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was \\nobviously not used to getting there in an ordinary \\nway. he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the \\nunderground, and complained loudly that the seats \\nwere too small and the trains too slow. \\n\\npage | 75 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i don’t know how the muggles manage without \\nmagic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down \\nescalator that led up to a bustling road lined with \\nshops. \\n\\nhagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; \\nall harry had to do was keep close behind him. they \\npassed book shops and music stores, hamburger \\nrestaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as \\nif it could sell you a magic wand. this was just an \\nordinary street full of ordinary people. could there \\nreally be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath \\nthem? were there really shops that sold spell books \\nand broomsticks? might this not all be some huge \\njoke that the dursleys had cooked up? if harry hadn’t \\nknown that the dursleys had no sense of humor, he \\nmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though \\neverything hagrid had told him so far was \\nunbelievable, harry couldn’t help trusting him. \\n\\n“this is it,” said hagrid, coming to a halt, “the leaky \\ncauldron. it’s a famous place.” \\n\\nit was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. if hagrid hadn’t \\npointed it out, harry wouldn’t have noticed it was \\nthere. the people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. their \\neyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the \\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the \\nleaky cauldron at all. in fact, harry had the most \\npeculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it. \\nbefore he could mention this, hagrid had steered him \\ninside. \\n\\nfor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. a \\nfew old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny \\nglasses of sherry. one of them was smoking a long \\npipe. a little man in a top hat was talking to the old \\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a \\ntoothless walnut. the low buzz of chatter stopped \\npage | 76 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen they walked in. everyone seemed to know \\nhagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the \\nbartender reached for a glass, saying, “the usual, \\nhagrid?” \\n\\n“can’t, tom, i’m on hogwarts business,” said hagrid, \\nclapping his great hand on harry’s shoulder and \\nmaking harry’s knees buckle. \\n\\n“good lord,” said the bartender, peering at harry, “is \\nthis — can this be — ?” \\n\\nthe leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely \\nstill and silent. \\n\\n“bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “harry \\npotter ... what an honor.” \\n\\nhe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward \\nharry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \\n\\n“welcome back, mr. potter, welcome back.” \\n\\nharry didn’t know what to say. everyone was looking \\nat him. the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it \\nwithout realizing it had gone out. hagrid was \\nbeaming. \\n\\nthen there was a great scraping of chairs and the \\nnext moment, harry found himself shaking hands \\nwith everyone in the leaky cauldron. \\n\\n“doris crockford, mr. potter, can’t believe i’m meeting \\nyou at last.” \\n\\n“so proud, mr. potter, i’m just so proud.” \\n\\n“always wanted to shake your hand — i’m all of a \\nflutter.” \\n\\npage | 77 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“delighted, mr. potter, just can’t tell you, diggle’s the \\nname, dedalus diggle.” \\n\\n“i’ve seen you before!” said harry, as dedalus diggle’s \\ntop hat fell off in his excitement. “you bowed to me \\nonce in a shop.” \\n\\n“he remembers!” cried dedalus diggle, looking \\naround at everyone. “did you hear that? he \\nremembers me!” \\n\\nharry shook hands again and again — doris \\ncrockford kept coming back for more. \\n\\na pale young man made his way forward, very \\nnervously. one of his eyes was twitching. \\n\\n“professor quirrell!” said hagrid. “harry, professor \\nquirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts.” \\n\\n“p-p-potter,” stammered professor quirrell, grasping \\nharry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased i am to \\nmeet you.” \\n\\n“what sort of magic do you teach, professor quirrell?” \\n\\n“d-defense against the d-d-dark arts,” muttered \\nprofessor quirrell, as though he’d rather not think \\nabout it. “n-not that you n-need it, eh, p-p-potter?” \\n\\nhe laughed nervously. “you’ll be g-getting all your \\nequipment, i suppose? i’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- \\nbook on vampires, m-myself.” he looked terrified at \\nthe very thought. \\n\\nbut the others wouldn’t let professor quirrell keep \\nharry to himself. it took almost ten minutes to get \\naway from them all. at last, hagrid managed to make \\nhimself heard over the babble. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 78 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“must get on — lots ter buy. come on, harry.” \\n\\ndoris crockford shook harry’s hand one last time, \\nand hagrid led them through the bar and out into a \\nsmall, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but \\na trash can and a few weeds. \\n\\nhagrid grinned at harry. \\n\\n“told yeh, didn’t i? told yeh you was famous. even \\nprofessor quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind \\nyou, he’s usually tremblin’.” \\n\\n“is he always that nervous?” \\n\\n“oh, yeah. poor bloke. brilliant mind. he was fine \\nwhile he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a \\nyear off ter get some firsthand experience. ... they say \\nhe met vampires in the black forest, and there was a \\nnasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same \\nsince. scared of the students, scared of his own \\nsubject — now, where’s me umbrella?” \\n\\nvampires? hags? harry’s head was swimming. \\n\\nhagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall \\nabove the trash can. \\n\\n“three up ... two across ...” he muttered. “right, \\nstand back, harry.” \\n\\nhe tapped the wall three times with the point of his \\numbrella. \\n\\nthe brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in \\nthe middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider \\nand wider — a second later they were facing an \\narchway large enough even for hagrid, an archway \\nonto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of \\nsight. \\n\\npage | 79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“welcome,” said hagrid, “to diagon alley.” \\n\\nhe grinned at harry’s amazement. they stepped \\nthrough the archway. harry looked quickly over his \\nshoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back \\ninto solid wall. \\n\\nthe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons \\noutside the nearest shop. cauldrons — all sizes — \\ncopper, brass, pewter, silver — self-stirring — \\ncollapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \\n\\n“yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said hagrid, “but we \\ngotta get yer money first.” \\n\\nharry wished he had about eight more eyes. he \\nturned his head in every direction as they walked up \\nthe street, trying to look at everything at once: the \\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their \\nshopping. a plump woman outside an apothecary \\nwas shaking her head as they passed, saying, \\n\\n“dragon liver, sixteen sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” \\n\\na low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign \\nsaying eeylops owl emporium — tawny, screech, \\nbarn, brown, and snowy. several boys of about \\nharry’s age had their noses pressed against a window \\nwith broomsticks in it. “look,” harry heard one of \\nthem say, “the new nimbus two thousand — fastest \\never — ” there were shops selling robes, shops selling \\ntelescopes and strange silver instruments harry had \\nnever seen before, windows stacked with barrels of \\nbat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell \\nbooks, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, \\nglobes of the moon. ... \\n\\n“gringotts,” said hagrid. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 80 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey had reached a snowy white building that \\ntowered over the other little shops. standing beside \\nits burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of \\nscarlet and gold, was — \\n\\n“yeah, that’s a goblin,” said hagrid quietly as they \\nwalked up the white stone steps toward him. the \\ngoblin was about a head shorter than harry. he had a \\nswarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, harry \\nnoticed, very long fingers and feet. he bowed as they \\nwalked inside. now they were facing a second pair of \\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon \\nthem: \\n\\nenter, stranger, but take heed \\n\\nof what awaits the sin of greed, \\n\\nfor those who take, but do not earn, \\n\\nmust pay most dearly in their turn. \\n\\nso if you seek beneath our floors \\n\\na treasure that was never yours, \\n\\nthief, you have been warned, beware \\n\\nof finding more than treasure there. \\n\\n“like i said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said \\nhagrid. \\n\\na pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors \\nand they were in a vast marble hall. about a hundred \\nmore goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long \\ncounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in \\nbrass scales, examining precious stones through \\neyeglasses. there were too many doors to count \\npage | 81 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleading off the hall, and yet more goblins were \\nshowing people in and out of these. hagrid and harry \\nmade for the counter. \\n\\n“morning,” said hagrid to a free goblin. “we’ve come \\nter take some money outta mr. harry potter’s safe.” \\n\\n“you have his key, sir?” \\n\\n“got it here somewhere,” said hagrid, and he started \\nemptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a \\nhandful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of \\nnumbers. the goblin wrinkled his nose. harry \\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of \\nrubies as big as glowing coals. \\n\\n“got it,” said hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden \\nkey. \\n\\nthe goblin looked at it closely. \\n\\n“that seems to be in order.” \\n\\n“an’ i’ve also got a letter here from professor \\ndumbledore,” said hagrid importantly, throwing out \\nhis chest. “it’s about the you-know-what in vault \\nseven hundred and thirteen.” \\n\\nthe goblin read the letter carefully. \\n\\n“very well,” he said, handing it back to hagrid, “i will \\nhave someone take you down to both vaults. \\ngriphook!” \\n\\ngriphook was yet another goblin. once hagrid had \\ncrammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, \\nhe and harry followed griphook toward one of the \\ndoors leading off the hall. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 82 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“what’s the you-know-what in vault seven hundred \\nand thirteen?” harry asked. \\n\\n“can’t tell yeh that,” said hagrid mysteriously. “very \\nsecret. hogwarts business. dumbledore’s trusted me. \\nmore’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” \\n\\ngriphook held the door open for them. harry, who \\nhad expected more marble, was surprised. they were \\nin a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming \\ntorches. it sloped steeply downward and there were \\nlittle railway tracks on the floor. griphook whistled \\nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward \\nthem. they climbed in — hagrid with some difficulty \\n— and were off. \\n\\nat first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting \\npassages. harry tried to remember, left, right, right, \\nleft, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. the \\nrattling cart seemed to know its own way, because \\ngriphook wasn’t steering. \\n\\nharry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, \\nbut he kept them wide open. once, he thought he saw \\na burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted \\naround to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they \\nplunged even deeper, passing an underground lake \\nwhere huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the \\nceiling and floor. \\n\\n“i never know,” harry called to hagrid over the noise \\nof the cart, “what’s the difference between a \\nstalagmite and a stalactite?” \\n\\n“stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said hagrid. “an’ don’ \\nask me questions just now, i think i’m gonna be \\nsick.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 83 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at \\nlast beside a small door in the passage wall, hagrid \\ngot out and had to lean against the wall to stop his \\nknees from trembling. \\n\\ngriphook unlocked the door. a lot of green smoke \\ncame billowing out, and as it cleared, harry gasped. \\ninside were mounds of gold coins. columns of silver. \\nheaps of little bronze knuts. \\n\\n“all yours,” smiled hagrid. \\n\\nall harry’s — it was incredible. the dursleys couldn’t \\nhave known about this or they’d have had it from him \\nfaster than blinking. how often had they complained \\nhow much harry cost them to keep? and all the time \\nthere had been a small fortune belonging to him, \\nburied deep under london. \\n\\nhagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag. \\n\\n“the gold ones are galleons,” he explained. \\n\\n“seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty-nine \\nknuts to a sickle, it’s easy enough. right, that should \\nbe enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest \\nsafe for yeh.” he turned to griphook. “vault seven \\nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go \\nmore slowly?” \\n\\n“one speed only,” said griphook. \\n\\nthey were going even deeper now and gathering \\nspeed. the air became colder and colder as they \\nhurtled round tight corners. they went rattling over \\nan underground ravine, and harry leaned over the \\nside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, \\nbut hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff \\nof his neck. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 84 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \\n\\n“stand back,” said griphook importantly. he stroked \\nthe door gently with one of his long fingers and it \\nsimply melted away. \\n\\n“if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be \\nsucked through the door and trapped in there,” said \\ngriphook. \\n\\n“how often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” \\nharry asked. \\n\\n“about once every ten years,” said griphook with a \\nrather nasty grin. \\n\\nsomething really extraordinary had to be inside this \\ntop security vault, harry was sure, and he leaned \\nforward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at \\nthe very least — but at first he thought it was empty. \\nthen he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up \\nin brown paper lying on the floor. hagrid picked it up \\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. harry longed to \\nknow what it was, but knew better than to ask. \\n\\n“come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to \\nme on the way back, it’s best if i keep me mouth \\nshut,” said hagrid. \\n\\n\\n\\none wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the \\nsunlight outside gringotts. harry didn’t know where \\nto run first now that he had a bag full of money. he \\ndidn’t have to know how many galleons there were to \\na pound to know that he was holding more money \\nthan he’d had in his whole life — more money than \\neven dudley had ever had. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 85 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“might as well get yer uniform,” said hagrid, nodding \\ntoward madam malkin’s robes for all occasions. \\n“listen, harry, would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a \\npick-me-up in the leaky cauldron? i hate them \\ngringotts carts.” he did still look a bit sick, so harry \\nentered madam malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. \\n\\nmadam malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all \\nin mauve. \\n\\n“hogwarts, dear?” she said, when harry started to \\nspeak. “got the lot here — another young man being \\nfitted up just now, in fact.” \\n\\nin the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed \\nface was standing on a footstool while a second witch \\npinned up his long black robes. madam malkin stood \\nharry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over \\nhis head, and began to pin it to the right length. \\n\\n“hello,” said the boy, “hogwarts, too?” \\n\\n“yes,” said harry. \\n\\n“my father’s next door buying my books and mother’s \\nup the street looking at wands,” said the boy. he had \\na bored, drawling voice. “then i’m going to drag them \\noff to look at racing brooms. i don’t see why first years \\ncan’t have their own. i think i’ll bully father into \\ngetting me one and i’ll smuggle it in somehow.” \\n\\nharry was strongly reminded of dudley. \\n\\n“have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. \\n\\n“no,” said harry. \\n\\n“play quidditch at all?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 86 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“no,” harry said again, wondering what on earth \\nquidditch could be. \\n\\n“ i do — father says it’s a crime if i’m not picked to \\nplay for my house, and i must say, i agree. know \\nwhat house you 11 be in yet?” \\n\\n“no,” said harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \\n\\n“well, no one really knows until they get there, do \\nthey, but i know i’ll be in slytherin, all our family \\nhave been — imagine being in hufflepuff, i think i’d \\nleave, wouldn’t you?” \\n\\n“mmm,” said harry, wishing he could say something a \\nbit more interesting. \\n\\n“i say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, \\nnodding toward the front window. hagrid was \\nstanding there, grinning at harry and pointing at two \\nlarge ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. \\n\\n“that’s hagrid,” said harry, pleased to know \\nsomething the boy didn’t. “he works at hogwarts.” \\n\\n“oh,” said the boy, “i’ve heard of him. he’s a sort of \\nservant, isn’t he?” \\n\\n“he’s the gamekeeper,” said harry. he was liking the \\nboy less and less every second. \\n\\n“yes, exactly. i heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a \\nhut on the school grounds and every now and then he \\ngets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire \\nto his bed.” \\n\\n“i think he’s brilliant,” said harry coldly. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 87 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “why is he \\nwith you? where are your parents?” \\n\\n“they’re dead,” said harry shortly. he didn’t feel \\nmuch like going into the matter with this boy. \\n\\n“oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \\n“but they were our kind, weren’t they?” \\n\\n“they were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you \\nmean.” \\n\\n“i really don’t think they should let the other sort in, \\ndo you? they’re just not the same, they’ve never been \\nbrought up to know our ways. some of them have \\nnever even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter, \\nimagine. i think they should keep it in the old \\nwizarding families. what’s your surname, anyway?” \\n\\nbut before harry could answer, madam malkin said, \\n“that’s you done, my dear,” and harry, not sorry for \\nan excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down \\nfrom the footstool. \\n\\n“well, i’ll see you at hogwarts, i suppose,” said the \\ndrawling boy. \\n\\nharry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid \\nhad bought him (chocolate and raspberry with \\nchopped nuts). \\n\\n“what’s up?” said hagrid. \\n\\n“nothing,” harry lied. they stopped to buy parchment \\nand quills. harry cheered up a bit when he found a \\nbottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. when \\nthey had left the shop, he said, “hagrid, what’s \\nquidditch?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 88 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“blimey, harry, i keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — \\nnot knowin’ about quidditch!” \\n\\n“don’t make me feel worse,” said harry. he told \\nhagrid about the pale boy in madam malkin’s. \\n\\n“ — and he said people from muggle families shouldn’t \\neven be allowed in — ” \\n\\n“yer not from a muggle family. if he’d known who yeh \\nwere — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his \\nparents are wizardin’ folk. you saw what everyone in \\nthe leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh. \\nanyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best \\ni ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a \\nlong line o’ muggles — look at yer mum! look what \\nshe had fer a sister!” \\n\\n“so what is quidditch?” \\n\\n“it’s our sport. wizard sport. it’s like — like soccer in \\nthe muggle world — everyone follows quidditch — \\nplayed up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four \\nballs — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” \\n\\n“and what are slytherin and hufflepuff?” \\n\\n“school houses. there’s four. everyone says \\nhufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” \\n\\n“i bet i’m in hufflepuff,” said harry gloomily. \\n\\n“better hufflepuff than slytherin,” said hagrid darkly. \\n“there’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad \\nwho wasn’t in slytherin. you-know-who was one.” \\n\\n“vol-, sorry — you-know-who was at hogwarts?” \\n\\n“years an’ years ago,” said hagrid. \\n\\npage | 89 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey bought harry’s school books in a shop called \\nflourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to \\nthe ceiling with books as large as paving stones \\nbound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in \\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a \\nfew books with nothing in them at all. even dudley, \\nwho never read anything, would have been wild to get \\nhis hands on some of these. hagrid almost had to \\ndrag harry away from curses and counter-curses \\n(bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies \\nwith the latest revenges: hair loss, jelly-legs, \\ntongue-tying and much, much more) by professor \\nvindictus viridian. \\n\\n“i was trying to find out how to curse dudley.” \\n\\n“i’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter \\nuse magic in the muggle world except in very special \\ncircumstances,” said hagrid. “an’ anyway, yeh \\ncouldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot \\nmore study before yeh get ter that level.” \\n\\nhagrid wouldn’t let harry buy a solid gold cauldron, \\neither (“it says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice \\nset of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a \\ncollapsible brass telescope. then they visited the \\napothecary, which was fascinating enough to make \\nup for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and \\nrotted cabbages. barrels of slimy stuff stood on the \\nfloor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders \\nlined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, \\nand snarled claws hung from the ceiling. while \\nhagrid asked the man behind the counter for a \\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for harry, \\nharry himself examined silver unicorn horns at \\ntwenty-one galleons each and minuscule, glittery- \\nblack beetle eyes (five knuts a scoop). \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 90 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\noutside the apothecary, hagrid checked harry’s list \\nagain. \\n\\n“just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ i still haven’t got \\nyeh a birthday present.” \\n\\nharry felt himself go red. \\n\\n“you don’t have to — ” \\n\\n“i know i don’t have to. tell yeh what, i’ll get yer \\nanimal. not a toad, toads went outta fashion years \\nago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ i don’ like cats, they \\nmake me sneeze. i’ll get yer an owl. all the kids want \\nowls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ \\neverythin’.” \\n\\ntwenty minutes later, they left eeylops owl \\nemporium, which had been dark and full of rustling \\nand flickering, jewel-bright eyes. harry now carried a \\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep \\nwith her head under her wing. he couldn’t stop \\nstammering his thanks, sounding just like professor \\nquirrell. \\n\\n“don’ mention it,” said hagrid gruffly. “don’ expect \\nyou’ve had a lotta presents from them dursleys. just \\nollivanders left now — only place fer wands, \\nollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” \\n\\na magic wand . . . this was what harry had been really \\nlooking forward to. \\n\\nthe last shop was narrow and shabby. peeling gold \\nletters over the door read ollivanders: makers of fine \\nwands since 382b. c. a single wand lay on a faded \\npurple cushion in the dusty window. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 91 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the \\nshop as they stepped inside. it was a tiny place, \\nempty except for a single, spindly chair that hagrid \\nsat on to wait. harry felt strangely as though he had \\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new \\nquestions that had just occurred to him and looked \\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly \\nright up to the ceiling. for some reason, the back of \\nhis neck prickled. the very dust and silence in here \\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic. \\n\\n“good afternoon,” said a soft voice. harry jumped. \\nhagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a \\nloud crunching noise and he got quickly off the \\nspindly chair. \\n\\nan old man was standing before them, his wide, pale \\neyes shining like moons through the gloom of the \\nshop. \\n\\n“hello,” said harry awkwardly. \\n\\n“ah yes,” said the man. “yes, yes. i thought i’d be \\nseeing you soon. harry potter.” it wasn’t a question. \\n“you have your mother’s eyes. it seems only yesterday \\nshe was in here herself, buying her first wand. ten \\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. \\nnice wand for charm work.” \\n\\nmr. ollivander moved closer to harry. harry wished \\nhe would blink. those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \\n\\n“your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany \\nwand. eleven inches. pliable. a little more power and \\nexcellent for transfiguration. well, i say your father \\nfavored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the \\nwizard, of course.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 92 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmr. ollivander had come so close that he and harry \\nwere almost nose to nose. harry could see himself \\nreflected in those misty eyes. \\n\\n“and that’s where ...” \\n\\nmr. ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry’s \\nforehead with a long, white finger. \\n\\n“i’m sorry to say i sold the wand that did it,” he said \\nsoftly. “thirteen-and-a-half inches. yew. powerful \\nwand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, \\nif i’d known what that wand was going out into the \\nworld to do. ...” \\n\\nhe shook his head and then, to harry’s relief, spotted \\nhagrid. \\n\\n“rubeus! rubeus hagrid! how nice to see you again. \\n\\n... oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” \\n\\n“it was, sir, yes,” said hagrid. \\n\\n“good wand, that one. but i suppose they snapped it \\nin half when you got expelled?” said mr. ollivander, \\nsuddenly stern. \\n\\n“er — yes, they did, yes,” said hagrid, shuffling his \\nfeet. “i’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added \\nbrightly. \\n\\n“but you don’t use them?” said mr. ollivander \\nsharply. \\n\\n“oh, no, sir,” said hagrid quickly. harry noticed he \\ngripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \\n\\n“hmmm,” said mr. ollivander, giving hagrid a \\npiercing look. “well, now — mr. potter. let me see.” \\n\\npage | 93 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe pulled a long tape measure with silver markings \\nout of his pocket. “which is your wand arm?” \\n\\n“er — well, i’m right-handed,” said harry. \\n\\n“hold out your arm. that’s it.” he measured harry \\nfrom shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder \\nto floor, knee to armpit and round his head. as he \\nmeasured, he said, “every ollivander wand has a core \\nof a powerful magical substance, mr. potter. we use \\nunicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the \\nheartstrings of dragons. no two ollivander wands are \\nthe same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or \\nphoenixes are quite the same. and of course, you will \\nnever get such good results with another wizard’s \\nwand.” \\n\\nharry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which \\nwas measuring between his nostrils, was doing this \\non its own. mr. ollivander was flitting around the \\nshelves, taking down boxes. \\n\\n“that will do,” he said, and the tape measure \\ncrumpled into a heap on the floor. “right then, mr. \\npotter. try this one. beech-wood and dragon \\nheartstring. nine inches. nice and flexible. just take \\nit and give it a wave.” \\n\\nharry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it \\naround a bit, but mr. ollivander snatched it out of his \\nhand almost at once. \\n\\n“maple and phoenix feather. seven inches. quite \\nwhippy. try — ” \\n\\nharry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand \\nwhen it, too, was snatched back by mr. ollivander. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 94 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“no, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a \\nhalf inches, springy. go on, go on, try it out.” \\n\\nharry tried. and tried. he had no idea what mr. \\nollivander was waiting for. the pile of tried wands \\nwas mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, \\nbut the more wands mr. ollivander pulled from the \\nshelves, the happier he seemed to become. \\n\\n“tricky customer, eh? not to worry, well find the \\nperfect match here somewhere — i wonder, now — \\nyes, why not — unusual combination — holly and \\nphoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” \\n\\nharry took the wand. he felt a sudden warmth in his \\nfingers. he raised the wand above his head, brought it \\nswishing down through the dusty air and a stream of \\nred and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, \\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls. hagrid \\nwhooped and clapped and mr. ollivander cried, “oh, \\nbravo! yes, indeed, oh, very good. well, well, well ... \\nhow curious ... how very curious ...” \\n\\nhe put harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it \\nin brown paper, still muttering, “curious . . . curious \\n\\n\\n\\n“sorry,” said harry, “but what’s curious?” \\n\\nmr. ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare. \\n\\n“i remember every wand i’ve ever sold, mr. potter. \\nevery single wand. it so happens that the phoenix \\nwhose tail feather is in your wand, gave another \\nfeather — just one other. it is very curious indeed \\nthat you should be destined for this wand when its \\nbrother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” \\n\\n\\n\\nharry swallowed. \\n\\npage | 95 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. yew. curious indeed \\nhow these things happen. the wand chooses the \\nwizard, remember. ... i think we must expect great \\nthings from you, mr. potter. ... after all, he-who- \\nmust-not-be-named did great things — terrible, yes, \\nbut great.” \\n\\nharry shivered. he wasn’t sure he liked mr. \\n\\nollivander too much. he paid seven gold galleons for \\nhis wand, and mr. ollivander bowed them from his \\nshop. \\n\\nthe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry \\nand hagrid made their way back down diagon alley, \\nback through the wall, back through the leaky \\ncauldron, now empty. harry didn’t speak at all as \\nthey walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how \\nmuch people were gawking at them on the \\nunderground, laden as they were with all their funny- \\nshaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its \\ncage on harry’s lap. up another escalator, out into \\npaddington station; harry only realized where they \\nwere when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \\n\\n“got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he \\nsaid. \\n\\nhe bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on \\nplastic seats to eat them. harry kept looking around. \\neverything looked so strange, somehow. \\n\\n“you all right, harry? yer very quiet,” said hagrid. \\n\\nharry wasn’t sure he could explain. he’d just had the \\nbest birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his \\nhamburger, trying to find the words. \\n\\n“everyone thinks i’m special,” he said at last. “all \\nthose people in the leaky cauldron, professor \\n\\npage | 96 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquirrell, mr. ollivander ... but i don’t know anything \\nabout magic at all. how can they expect great things? \\ni’m famous and i can’t even remember what i’m \\nfamous for. i don’t know what happened when vol-, \\nsorry — i mean, the night my parents died.” \\n\\nhagrid leaned across the table. behind the wild beard \\nand eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \\n\\n“don’ you worry, harry. you’ll learn fast enough. \\neveryone starts at the beginning at hogwarts, you’ll \\nbe just fine. just be yerself. i know it’s hard. yeh’ve \\nbeen singled out, an’ that’s always hard. but yeh’ll \\nhave a great time at hogwarts — i did — still do, \\n’smatter of fact.” \\n\\nhagrid helped harry on to the train that would take \\nhim back to the dursleys, then handed him an \\nenvelope. \\n\\n“yer ticket fer hogwarts,” he said. “first o’ september \\n— king’s cross — it’s all on yer ticket. any problems \\nwith the dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll \\nknow where to find me. ... see yeh soon, harry.” \\n\\nthe train pulled out of the station. harry wanted to \\nwatch hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his \\nseat and pressed his nose against the window, but he \\nblinked and hagrid had gone. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 97 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe journey from platform \\nnine and three-quarters \\n\\nharry’s last month with the dursleys wasn’t fun. \\ntrue, dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn’t \\nstay in the same room, while aunt petunia and uncle \\nvernon didn’t shut harry in his cupboard, force him \\nto do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t \\nspeak to him at all. half terrified, half furious, they \\nacted as though any chair with harry in it were \\nempty. although this was an improvement in many \\nways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. \\n\\nharry kept to his room, with his new owl for \\ncompany. he had decided to call her hedwig, a name \\nhe had found in a history of magic. his school books \\nwere very interesting. he lay on his bed reading late \\ninto the night, hedwig swooping in and out of the \\nopen window as she pleased. it was lucky that aunt \\npetunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because \\nhedwig kept bringing back dead mice. every night \\nbefore he went to sleep, harry ticked off another day \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 98 \\n\\n\\n\\non the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, \\ncounting down to september the first. \\n\\non the last day of august he thought he’d better \\nspeak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king’s \\ncross station the next day, so he went down to the \\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on \\ntelevision. he cleared his throat to let them know he \\nwas there, and dudley screamed and ran from the \\nroom. \\n\\n“er — uncle vernon?” \\n\\nuncle vernon grunted to show he was listening. \\n\\n“er — i need to be at king’s cross tomorrow to — to \\ngo to hogwarts.” \\n\\nuncle vernon grunted again. \\n\\n“would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” \\n\\ngrunt. harry supposed that meant yes. \\n\\n“thank you.” \\n\\nhe was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon \\nactually spoke. \\n\\n“funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. \\nmagic carpets all got punctures, have they?” \\n\\nharry didn’t say anything. \\n\\n“where is this school, anyway?” \\n\\n“i don’t know,” said harry, realizing this for the first \\ntime. he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of \\nhis pocket. \\n\\npage | 99 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i just take the train from platform nine and three- \\nquarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. \\n\\nhis aunt and uncle stared. \\n\\n“platform what?” \\n\\n“nine and three-quarters.” \\n\\n“don’t talk rubbish,” said uncle vernon. “there is no \\nplatform nine and three-quarters.” \\n\\n“it’s on my ticket.” \\n\\n“barking,” said uncle vernon, “howling mad, the lot of \\nthem. you 11 see. you just wait. all right, we’ll take \\nyou to king’s cross. we’re going up to london \\ntomorrow anyway, or i wouldn’t bother.” \\n\\n“why are you going to london?” harry asked, trying \\nto keep things friendly. \\n\\n“taking dudley to the hospital,” growled uncle \\nvernon. “got to have that ruddy tail removed before \\nhe goes to smeltings.” \\n\\nharry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was \\ntoo excited and nervous to go back to sleep. he got up \\nand pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to \\nwalk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d \\nchange on the train. he checked his hogwarts list yet \\nagain to make sure he had everything he needed, saw \\nthat hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then \\npaced the room, waiting for the dursleys to get up. \\ntwo hours later, harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been \\nloaded into the dursleys’ car, aunt petunia had \\ntalked dudley into sitting next to harry, and they had \\nset off. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 100 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey reached king’s cross at half past ten. uncle \\nvernon dumped harry’s trunk onto a cart and \\nwheeled it into the station for him. harry thought this \\nwas strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead, \\nfacing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \\n\\n“well, there you are, boy. platform nine — platform \\nten. your platform should be somewhere in the \\nmiddle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do \\nthey?” \\n\\nhe was quite right, of course. there was a big plastic \\nnumber nine over one platform and a big plastic \\nnumber ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, \\nnothing at all. \\n\\n“have a good term,” said uncle vernon with an even \\nnastier smile. he left without another word. harry \\nturned and saw the dursleys drive away. all three of \\nthem were laughing. harry’s mouth went rather dry. \\nwhat on earth was he going to do? he was starting to \\nattract a lot of funny looks, because of hedwig. he’d \\nhave to ask someone. \\n\\nhe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention \\nplatform nine and three-quarters. the guard had \\nnever heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn’t \\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he \\nstarted to get annoyed, as though harry was being \\nstupid on purpose. getting desperate, harry asked for \\nthe train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said \\nthere wasn’t one. in the end the guard strode away, \\nmuttering about time wasters. harry was now trying \\nhard not to panic. according to the large clock over \\nthe arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on \\nthe train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; \\nhe was stranded in the middle of a station with a \\ntrunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard \\nmoney, and a large owl. \\n\\npage | 101 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you \\nhad to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to \\nget into diagon alley. he wondered if he should get \\nout his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s \\nstand between platforms nine and ten. \\n\\nat that moment a group of people passed just behind \\nhim and he caught a few words of what they were \\nsaying. \\n\\n“ — packed with muggles, of course — ” \\n\\nharry swung round. the speaker was a plump \\nwoman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming \\nred hair. each of them was pushing a trunk like \\nharry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. \\n\\nheart hammering, harry pushed his cart after them. \\nthey stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear \\nwhat they were saying. \\n\\n“now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ \\nmother. \\n\\n“nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- \\nheaded, who was holding her hand, “mom, can’t i go \\n\\n\\n\\n“you’re not old enough, ginny, now be quiet. all right, \\npercy, you go first.” \\n\\nwhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward \\nplatforms nine and ten. harry watched, careful not to \\nblink in case he missed it — but just as the boy \\nreached the dividing barrier between the two \\nplatforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in \\nfront of him and by the time the last backpack had \\ncleared away, the boy had vanished. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 102 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“fred, you next,” the plump woman said. \\n\\n\\n\\n“i’m not fred, i’m george,” said the boy. “honestly, \\nwoman, you call yourself our mother? can’t you tell \\ni’m george?” \\n\\n“sorry, george, dear.” \\n\\n“only joking, i am fred,” said the boy, and off he \\nwent. his twin called after him to hurry up, and he \\nmust have done so, because a second later, he had \\ngone — but how had he done it? \\n\\nnow the third brother was walking briskly toward the \\nbarrier — he was almost there — and then, quite \\nsuddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. \\n\\nthere was nothing else for it. \\n\\n“excuse me,” harry said to the plump woman. \\n\\n“hello, dear,” she said. “first time at hogwarts? ron’s \\nnew, too.” \\n\\nshe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. he \\nwas tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands \\nand feet, and a long nose. \\n\\n“yes,” said harry. “the thing is — the thing is, i don’t \\nknow how to — ” \\n\\n“how to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and \\nharry nodded. \\n\\n“not to worry,” she said. “all you have to do is walk \\nstraight at the barrier between platforms nine and \\nten. don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into \\nit, that’s very important. best do it at a bit of a run if \\nyou’re nervous. go on, go now before ron.” \\n\\npage | 103 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“er — okay,” said harry. \\n\\nhe pushed his trolley around and stared at the \\nbarrier. it looked very solid. \\n\\nhe started to walk toward it. people jostled him on \\ntheir way to platforms nine and ten. harry walked \\nmore quickly. he was going to smash right into that \\nbarrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward \\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier \\nwas coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able \\nto stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot \\naway — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — \\n\\nit didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his \\neyes. \\n\\na scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform \\npacked with people. a sign overhead said hogwarts \\nexpress, eleven o’clock. harry looked behind him and \\nsaw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had \\nbeen, with the words platform nine and three- \\nquarters on it. he had done it. \\n\\nsmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the \\nchattering crowd, while cats of every color wound \\nhere and there between their legs. owls hooted to one \\nanother in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble \\nand the scraping of heavy trunks. \\n\\nthe first few carriages were already packed with \\nstudents, some hanging out of the window to talk to \\ntheir families, some fighting over seats. harry pushed \\nhis cart off down the platform in search of an empty \\nseat. he passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \\n“gran, i’ve lost my toad again.” \\n\\n“oh, neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 104 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small \\ncrowd. \\n\\n\\n\\n“give us a look, lee, go on.” \\n\\nthe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the \\npeople around him shrieked and yelled as something \\ninside poked out a long, hairy leg. \\n\\nharry pressed on through the crowd until he found \\nan empty compartment near the end of the train. he \\nput hedwig inside first and then started to shove and \\nheave his trunk toward the train door. he tried to lift \\nit up the steps but could hardly raise one end and \\ntwice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \\n\\n“want a hand?” it was one of the red-haired twins \\nhe’d followed through the barrier. \\n\\n“yes, please,” harry panted. \\n\\n“oy, fred! c’mere and help!” \\n\\nwith the twins’ help, harry’s trunk was at last tucked \\naway in a corner of the compartment. \\n\\n“thanks,” said harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of \\nhis eyes. \\n\\n“what’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, \\npointing at harry’s lightning scar. \\n\\n“blimey,” said the other twin. “are you — ?” \\n\\n“he is,” said the first twin. “aren’t you?” he added to \\nharry. \\n\\n“what?” said harry. \\n\\npage | 105 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ harry potter,” chorused the twins. \\n\\n“oh, him,” said harry. “i mean, yes, i am.” \\n\\nthe two boys gawked at him, and harry felt himself \\nturning red. then, to his relief, a voice came floating \\nin through the train’s open door. \\n\\n“fred? george? are you there?” \\n\\n“coming, mom.” \\n\\nwith a last look at harry, the twins hopped off the \\ntrain. \\n\\nharry sat down next to the window where, half \\nhidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the \\nplatform and hear what they were saying. their \\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief. \\n\\n“ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” \\n\\nthe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she \\ngrabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \\n\\n“mom — geroff.” he wriggled free. \\n\\n“aaah, has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” \\nsaid one of the twins. \\n\\n“shut up,” said ron. \\n\\n“where’s percy?” said their mother. \\n\\n“he’s coming now.” \\n\\nthe oldest boy came striding into sight. he had \\nalready changed into his billowing black hogwarts \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 106 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nrobes, and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge \\non his chest with the letter p on it. \\n\\n“can’t stay long, mother,” he said. “i’m up front, the \\nprefects have got two compartments to themselves — ” \\n\\n“oh, are you a prefect, percy?” said one of the twins, \\nwith an air of great surprise. “you should have said \\nsomething, we had no idea.” \\n\\n“hang on, i think i remember him saying something \\nabout it,” said the other twin. “once — ” \\n\\n“or twice — ” \\n\\n“a minute — ” \\n\\n“all summer — ” \\n\\n“oh, shut up,” said percy the prefect. \\n\\n“how come percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one \\nof the twins. \\n\\n“because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “all \\nright, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl \\nwhen you get there.” \\n\\nshe kissed percy on the cheek and he left. then she \\nturned to the twins. \\n\\n“now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. if i \\nget one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up \\na toilet or — ” \\n\\n“blown up a toilet? we’ve never blown up a toilet.” \\n“great idea though, thanks, mom.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 107 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“it’s not funny. and look after ron.” \\n\\n“don’t worry, ickle ronniekins is safe with us.” \\n\\n“shut up,” said ron again. he was almost as tall as \\nthe twins already and his nose was still pink where \\nhis mother had rubbed it. \\n\\n“hey, mom, guess what? guess who we just met on \\nthe train?” \\n\\nharry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him \\nlooking. \\n\\n“you know that black-haired boy who was near us in \\nthe station? know who he is?” \\n\\n“who?” \\n\\n“ harry potted” \\n\\nharry heard the little girl’s voice. \\n\\n“oh, mom, can i go on the train and see him, mom, \\noh please. ...” \\n\\n“you’ve already seen him, ginny, and the poor boy \\nisn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. is he really, \\nfred? how do you know?” \\n\\n“asked him. saw his scar. it’s really there — like \\nlightning.” \\n\\n“poor dear — no wonder he was alone, i wondered. he \\nwas ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the \\nplatform.” \\n\\n“never mind that, do you think he remembers what \\nyou-know-who looks like?” \\n\\npage | 108 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir mother suddenly became very stern. \\n\\n\\n\\n“i forbid you to ask him, fred. no, don’t you dare. as \\nthough he needs reminding of that on his first day at \\nschool.” \\n\\n“all right, keep your hair on.” \\n\\na whistle sounded. \\n\\n“hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys \\nclambered onto the train. they leaned out of the \\nwindow for her to kiss them good-bye, and their \\nyounger sister began to cry. \\n\\n“don’t, ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” \\n\\n“well send you a hogwarts toilet seat.” \\n\\n“ georg e\\\\” \\n\\n“only joking, mom.” \\n\\nthe train began to move. harry saw the boys’ mother \\nwaving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, \\nrunning to keep up with the train until it gathered too \\nmuch speed, then she fell back and waved. \\n\\nharry watched the girl and her mother disappear as \\nthe train rounded the corner. houses flashed past the \\nwindow. harry felt a great leap of excitement. he \\ndidn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be \\nbetter than what he was leaving behind. \\n\\nthe door of the compartment slid open and the \\nyoungest redheaded boy came in. \\n\\n“anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat \\nopposite harry. “everywhere else is full.” \\n\\npage | 109 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry shook his head and the boy sat down. he \\nglanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the \\nwindow, pretending he hadn’t looked. harry saw he \\nstill had a black mark on his nose. \\n\\n“hey, ron.” \\n\\nthe twins were back. \\n\\n“listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — \\n\\nlee jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” \\n\\n“right,” mumbled ron. \\n\\n“harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce \\nourselves? fred and george weasley. and this is ron, \\nour brother. see you later, then.” \\n\\n“bye,” said harry and ron. the twins slid the \\ncompartment door shut behind them. \\n\\n“are you really harry potter?” ron blurted out. \\n\\nharry nodded. \\n\\n“oh — well, i thought it might be one of fred and \\ngeorge’s jokes,” said ron. “and have you really got — \\nyou know ...” \\n\\nhe pointed at harry’s forehead. \\n\\nharry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning \\nscar. ron stared. \\n\\n“so that’s where you-know-who — ?” \\n\\n“yes,” said harry, “but i can’t remember it.” \\n\\n“nothing?” said ron eagerly. \\n\\npage | 110 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“well — i remember a lot of green light, but nothing \\nelse.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“wow,” said ron. he sat and stared at harry for a few \\nmoments, then, as though he had suddenly realized \\nwhat he was doing, he looked quickly out of the \\nwindow again. \\n\\n“are all your family wizards?” asked harry, who found \\nron just as interesting as ron found him. \\n\\n“er — yes, i think so,” said ron. “i think mom’s got a \\nsecond cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk \\nabout him.” \\n\\n“so you must know loads of magic already.” \\n\\nthe weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding \\nfamilies the pale boy in diagon alley had talked \\nabout. \\n\\n“i heard you went to live with muggles,” said ron. \\n“what are they like?” \\n\\n“horrible — well, not all of them. my aunt and uncle \\nand cousin are, though. wish i’d had three wizard \\nbrothers.” \\n\\n“five,” said ron. for some reason, he was looking \\ngloomy. “i’m the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts. \\nyou could say i’ve got a lot to live up to. bill and \\ncharlie have already left — bill was head boy and \\ncharlie was captain of quidditch. now percy’s a \\nprefect. fred and george mess around a lot, but they \\nstill get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re \\nreally funny. everyone expects me to do as well as the \\nothers, but if i do, it’s no big deal, because they did it \\nfirst. you never get anything new, either, with five \\n\\npage | 111 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbrothers. i’ve got bill’s old robes, charlie’s old wand, \\nand percy’s old rat.” \\n\\nron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat \\ngray rat, which was asleep. \\n\\n“his name’s scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever \\nwakes up. percy got an owl from my dad for being \\nmade a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — i mean, i got \\nscabbers instead.” \\n\\nron’s ears went pink. he seemed to think he’d said \\ntoo much, because he went back to staring out of the \\nwindow. \\n\\nharry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not \\nbeing able to afford an owl. after all, he’d never had \\nany money in his life until a month ago, and he told \\nron so, all about having to wear dudley’s old clothes \\nand never getting proper birthday presents. this \\nseemed to cheer ron up. \\n\\n\"... and until hagrid told me, i didn’t know anything \\nabout being a wizard or about my parents or \\nvoldemort — ” \\n\\nron gasped. \\n\\n“what?” said harry. \\n\\n“ you said you-know-who’s name\\\\” said ron, sounding \\nboth shocked and impressed. “i’d have thought you, \\nof all people — ” \\n\\n“i’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the \\nname,” said harry, “i just never knew you shouldn’t. \\nsee what i mean? i’ve got loads to learn. ... i bet,” he \\nadded, voicing for the first time something that had \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 112 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbeen worrying him a lot lately, “i bet i’m the worst in \\nthe class.” \\n\\n“you won’t be. there’s loads of people who come from \\nmuggle families and they learn quick enough.” \\n\\nwhile they had been talking, the train had carried \\nthem out of london. now they were speeding past \\nfields full of cows and sheep. they were quiet for a \\ntime, watching the fields and lanes flick past. \\n\\naround half past twelve there was a great clattering \\noutside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman \\nslid back their door and said, “anything off the cart, \\ndears?” \\n\\nharry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, \\nbut ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that \\nhe’d brought sandwiches. harry went out into the \\ncorridor. \\n\\nhe had never had any money for candy with the \\ndursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with \\ngold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars \\nbars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have \\nmars bars. what she did have were bertie bott’s \\nevery flavor beans, drooble’s best blowing gum, \\nchocolate frogs, pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, \\nlicorice wands, and a number of other strange things \\nharry had never seen in his life. not wanting to miss \\nanything, he got some of everything and paid the \\nwoman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts. \\n\\nron stared as harry brought it all back in to the \\ncompartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \\n\\n“hungry, are you?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 113 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“starving,” said harry, taking a large bite out of a \\npumpkin pasty. \\n\\nron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped \\nit. there were four sandwiches inside. he pulled one \\nof them apart and said, “she always forgets i don’t \\nlike corned beef.” \\n\\n“swap you for one of these,” said harry, holding up a \\npasty. “go on — ” \\n\\n“you don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said ron. “she \\nhasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, \\nwith five of us.” \\n\\n“go on, have a pasty,” said harry, who had never had \\nanything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share \\nit with. it was a nice feeling, sitting there with ron, \\neating their way through all harry’s pasties, cakes, \\nand candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \\n\\n“what are these?” harry asked ron, holding up a \\npack of chocolate frogs. “they’re not really frogs, are \\nthey?” he was starting to feel that nothing would \\nsurprise him. \\n\\n“no,” said ron. “but see what the card is. i’m missing \\nagrippa.” \\n\\n“what?” \\n\\n“oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — chocolate frogs \\nhave cards inside them, you know, to collect — \\nfamous witches and wizards. i’ve got about five \\nhundred, but i haven’t got agrippa or ptolemy.” \\n\\nharry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up \\nthe card. it showed a man’s face. he wore half-moon \\nglasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver \\n\\npage | 114 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhair, beard, and mustache. underneath the picture \\nwas the name albus dumbledore. \\n\\n\\n\\n“so this is dumbledore!” said harry. \\n\\n“don’t tell me you’d never heard of dumbledore!” said \\nron. “can i have a frog? i might get agrippa — thanks \\n\\n\\n\\nharry turned over his card and read: \\n\\nalbus dumbledore \\n\\ncurrently headmaster of hogwarts \\n\\nconsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern \\ntimes, dumbledore is particularly famous for his \\ndefeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the \\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his \\nwork on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel. \\nprofessor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten \\npin bowling. \\n\\nharry turned the card back over and saw, to his \\nastonishment, that dumbledore ’s face had \\ndisappeared. \\n\\n“he’s gone!” \\n\\n“well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” \\nsaid ron. “he’ll be back. no, i’ve got morgana again \\nand i’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? you \\ncan start collecting.” \\n\\nron’s eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs \\nwaiting to be unwrapped. \\n\\n“help yourself,” said harry. “but in, you know, the \\nmuggle world, people just stay put in photos.” \\n\\npage | 115 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“do they? what, they don’t move at all?” ron sounded \\namazed. “weird).” \\n\\n\\n\\nharry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the \\npicture on his card and gave him a small smile. ron \\nwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking \\nat the famous witches and wizards cards, but harry \\ncouldn’t keep his eyes off them. soon he had not only \\ndumbledore and morgana, but hengist of woodcraft, \\nalberic grunnion, circe, paracelsus, and merlin. he \\nfinally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna, \\nwho was scratching her nose, to open a bag of bertie \\nbott’s every flavor beans. \\n\\n“you want to be careful with those,” ron warned \\nharry. “when they say every flavor, they mean every \\nflavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like \\nchocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then \\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. george \\nreckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” \\n\\nron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, \\nand bit into a corner. \\n\\n“bleaaargh — see? sprouts.” \\n\\nthey had a good time eating the every flavor beans. \\nharry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, \\ncurry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave \\nenough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron \\nwouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. \\n\\nthe countryside now flying past the window was \\nbecoming wilder. the neat fields had gone. now there \\nwere woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \\n\\nthere was a knock on the door of their compartment \\nand the round-faced boy harry had passed on \\n\\npage | 116 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplatform nine and three-quarters came in. he looked \\ntearful. \\n\\n\\n\\n“sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” \\n\\nwhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “i’ve lost \\nhim! he keeps getting away from me!” \\n\\n“hell turn up,” said harry. \\n\\n“yes,” said the boy miserably. “well, if you see him ...” \\nhe left. \\n\\n“don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said ron. “if i’d \\nbrought a toad i’d lose it as quick as i could. mind \\nyou, i brought scabbers, so i can’t talk.” \\n\\nthe rat was still snoozing on ron’s lap. \\n\\n“he might have died and you wouldn’t know the \\ndifference,” said ron in disgust. “i tried to turn him \\nyellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but \\nthe spell didn’t work. i’ll show you, look ...” \\n\\nhe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a \\nvery battered-looking wand. it was chipped in places \\nand something white was glinting at the end. \\n\\n“unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. anyway — ” \\n\\nhe had just raised his wand when the compartment \\ndoor slid open again. the toadless boy was back, but \\nthis time he had a girl with him. she was already \\nwearing her new hogwarts robes. \\n\\n“has anyone seen a toad? neville’s lost one,” she said. \\nshe had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown \\nhair, and rather large front teeth. \\n\\npage | 117 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“we’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said ron, \\nbut the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the \\nwand in his hand. \\n\\n“oh, are you doing magic? let’s see it, then.” \\n\\nshe sat down. ron looked taken aback. \\n\\n“er — all right.” \\n\\nhe cleared his throat. \\n\\n“ sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, \\n\\nturn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” \\n\\nhe waved his wand, but nothing happened. scabbers \\nstayed gray and fast asleep. \\n\\n“are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “well, \\nit’s not very good, is it? i’ve tried a few simple spells \\njust for practice and it’s all worked for me. nobody in \\nmy family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise \\nwhen i got my letter, but i was ever so pleased, of \\ncourse, i mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft \\nthere is, i’ve heard — i’ve learned all our course books \\nby heart, of course, i just hope it will be enough — i’m \\nhermione granger, by the way, who are you?” \\n\\nshe said all this very fast. \\n\\nharry looked at ron, and was relieved to see by his \\nstunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course \\nbooks by heart either. \\n\\n“i’m ron weasley,” ron muttered. \\n\\n“harry potter,” said harry. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 118 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“are you really?” said hermione. “i know all about \\nyou, of course — i got a few extra books for \\nbackground reading, and you’re in modern magical \\nhistory and the rise and fall of the dark arts and \\ngreat wizarding events of the twentieth century.” \\n\\n“am i?” said harry, feeling dazed. \\n\\n“goodness, didn’t you know, i’d have found out \\neverything i could if it was me,” said hermione. “do \\neither of you know what house you’ll be in? i’ve been \\nasking around, and i hope i’m in gryffindor, it sounds \\nby far the best; i hear dumbledore himself was in it, \\nbut i suppose ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... \\nanyway, we’d better go and look for neville’s toad. \\n\\nyou two had better change, you know, i expect we’ll \\nbe there soon.” \\n\\nand she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \\n\\n“whatever house i’m in, i hope she’s not in it,” said \\nron. he threw his wand back into his trunk. “stupid \\nspell — george gave it to me, bet he knew it was a \\ndud.” \\n\\n“what house are your brothers in?” asked harry. \\n\\n“gryffindor,” said ron. gloom seemed to be settling \\non him again. “mom and dad were in it, too. i don’t \\nknow what they’ll say if i’m not. i don’t suppose \\nravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put \\nme in slytherin.” \\n\\n“that’s the house vol-, i mean, you-know-who was \\nin?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“yeah,” said ron. he flopped back into his seat, \\nlooking depressed. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 119 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you know, i think the ends of scabbers’ whiskers are \\na bit lighter,” said harry, trying to take ron’s mind off \\nhouses. “so what do your oldest brothers do now that \\nthey’ve left, anyway?” \\n\\nharry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d \\nfinished school. \\n\\n“charlie’s in romania studying dragons, and bill’s in \\nafrica doing something for gringotts,” said ron. “did \\nyou hear about gringotts? it’s been all over the daily \\nprophet, but i don’t suppose you get that with the \\nmuggles — someone tried to rob a high security \\nvault.” \\n\\nharry stared. \\n\\n“really? what happened to them?” \\n\\n“nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. they haven’t \\nbeen caught. my dad says it must’ve been a powerful \\ndark wizard to get round gringotts, but they don’t \\nthink they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’course, \\neveryone gets scared when something like this \\nhappens in case you-know-who’s behind it.” \\n\\nharry turned this news over in his mind. he was \\nstarting to get a prickle of fear every time you-know- \\nwho was mentioned. he supposed this was all part of \\nentering the magical world, but it had been a lot more \\ncomfortable saying “voldemort” without worrying. \\n\\n“what’s your quidditch team?” ron asked. \\n\\n“er — i don’t know any,” harry confessed. \\n\\n“what!” ron looked dumbfounded. “oh, you wait, it’s \\nthe best game in the world — ” and he was off, \\nexplaining all about the four balls and the positions of \\n\\npage | 120 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe seven players, describing famous games he’d been \\nto with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to \\nget if he had the money. he was just taking harry \\nthrough the finer points of the game when the \\ncompartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t \\nneville the toadless boy, or hermione granger this \\ntime. \\n\\nthree boys entered, and harry recognized the middle \\none at once: it was the pale boy from madam malkin’s \\nrobe shop. he was looking at harry with a lot more \\ninterest than he’d shown back in diagon alley. \\n\\n“is it true?” he said. “they’re saying all down the train \\nthat harry potter’s in this compartment. so it’s you, is \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“yes,” said harry. he was looking at the other boys. \\nboth of them were thickset and looked extremely \\nmean. standing on either side of the pale boy, they \\nlooked like bodyguards. \\n\\n“oh, this is crabbe and this is goyle,” said the pale \\nboy carelessly, noticing where harry was looking. \\n\\n“and my names malfoy, draco malfoy.” \\n\\nron gave a slight cough, which might have been \\nhiding a snigger. draco malfoy looked at him. \\n\\n“think my name’s funny, do you? no need to ask who \\nyou are. my father told me all the weasleys have red \\nhair, freckles, and more children than they can \\nafford.” \\n\\nhe turned back to harry. “you’ll soon find out some \\nwizarding families are much better than others, \\n\\npotter. you don’t want to go making friends with the \\nwrong sort. i can help you there.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 121 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe held out his hand to shake harry’s, but harry \\ndidn’t take it. \\n\\n“i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, \\nthanks,” he said coolly. \\n\\ndraco malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared \\nin his pale cheeks. \\n\\n“i’d be careful if i were you, potter,” he said slowly. \\n“unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as \\nyour parents. they didn’t know what was good for \\nthem, either. you hang around with riffraff like the \\nweasleys and that hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” \\n\\nboth harry and ron stood up. \\n\\n“say that again,” ron said, his face as red as his hair. \\n\\n“oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” malfoy \\nsneered. \\n\\n“unless you get out now,” said harry, more bravely \\nthan he felt, because crabbe and goyle were a lot \\nbigger than him or ron. \\n\\n“but we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? we’ve \\neaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” \\n\\ngoyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to \\nron — ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as \\ntouched goyle, goyle let out a horrible yell. \\n\\nscabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp \\nlittle teeth sunk deep into goyle ’s knuckle — crabbe \\nand malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers \\nround and round, howling, and when scabbers finally \\nflew off and hit the window, all three of them \\ndisappeared at once. perhaps they thought there were \\npage | 122 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmore rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps \\nthey’d heard footsteps, because a second later, \\nhermione granger had come in. \\n\\n“what has been going on?” she said, looking at the \\nsweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers \\nby his tail. \\n\\n“i think he’s been knocked out,” ron said to harry. \\n\\nhe looked closer at scabbers. “no — i don’t believe it \\n— he’s gone back to sleep.” \\n\\nand so he had. \\n\\n“you’ve met malfoy before?” \\n\\nharry explained about their meeting in diagon alley. \\n\\n“i’ve heard of his family,” said ron darkly. “they were \\nsome of the first to come back to our side after you- \\nknow-who disappeared. said they’d been bewitched. \\nmy dad doesn’t believe it. he says malfoy’s father \\ndidn’t need an excuse to go over to the dark side.” he \\nturned to hermione. “can we help you with \\nsomething?” \\n\\n“you’d better hurry up and put your robes on, i’ve \\njust been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he \\nsays we’re nearly there. you haven’t been fighting, \\nhave you? you’ll be in trouble before we even get \\nthere!” \\n\\n“scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said ron, \\nscowling at her. “would you mind leaving while we \\nchange?” \\n\\n“all right — i only came in here because people \\noutside are behaving very childishly, racing up and \\ndown the corridors,” said hermione in a sniffy voice. \\n\\npage | 123 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“and you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you \\nknow?” \\n\\n\\n\\nron glared at her as she left. harry peered out of the \\nwindow. it was getting dark. he could see mountains \\nand forests under a deep purple sky. the train did \\nseem to be slowing down. \\n\\nhe and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their \\nlong black robes. ron’s were a bit short for him, you \\ncould see his sneakers underneath them. \\n\\na voice echoed through the train: “we will be reaching \\nhogwarts in five minutes’ time. please leave your \\nluggage on the train, it will be taken to the school \\nseparately.” \\n\\nharry’s stomach lurched with nerves and ron, he \\nsaw, looked pale under his freckles. they crammed \\ntheir pockets with the last of the sweets and joined \\nthe crowd thronging the corridor. \\n\\nthe train slowed right down and finally stopped. \\npeople pushed their way toward the door and out on \\nto a tiny, dark platform. harry shivered in the cold \\nnight air. then a lamp came bobbing over the heads \\nof the students, and harry heard a familiar voice: \\n“firs’ years! firs’ years over here! all right there, \\nharry?” \\n\\nhagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \\n\\n“c’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? mind yer \\nstep, now! firs’ years follow me!” \\n\\nslipping and stumbling, they followed hagrid down \\nwhat seemed to be a steep, narrow path. it was so \\ndark on either side of them that harry thought there \\nmust be thick trees there. nobody spoke much. \\n\\npage | 124 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nneville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once \\nor twice. \\n\\n\\n\\n“yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ hogwarts in a sec,” hagrid \\ncalled over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” \\n\\nthere was a loud “oooooh!” \\n\\nthe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge \\nof a great black lake. perched atop a high mountain \\non the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry \\nsky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \\n\\n“no more’n four to a boat!” hagrid called, pointing to \\na fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. \\nharry and ron were followed into their boat by neville \\nand hermione. \\n\\n“everyone in?” shouted hagrid, who had a boat to \\nhimself. “right then — forward!” \\n\\nand the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, \\ngliding across the lake, which was as smooth as \\nglass. everyone was silent, staring up at the great \\ncastle overhead. it towered over them as they sailed \\nnearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \\n\\n“heads down!” yelled hagrid as the first boats reached \\nthe cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats \\ncarried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide \\nopening in the cliff face. they were carried along a \\ndark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right \\nunderneath the castle, until they reached a kind of \\nunderground harbor, where they clambered out onto \\nrocks and pebbles. \\n\\n“oy, you there! is this your toad?” said hagrid, who \\nwas checking the boats as people climbed out of \\nthem. \\n\\npage | 125 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“trevor!” cried neville blissfully, holding out his \\nhands. then they clambered up a passageway in the \\nrock after hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto \\nsmooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. \\n\\nthey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded \\naround the huge, oak front door. \\n\\n“everyone here? you there, still got yer toad?” \\n\\nhagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times \\non the castle door. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 126 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe sorting hat \\n\\nthe door swung open at once. a tall, black-haired \\nwitch in emerald-green robes stood there. she had a \\nvery stern face and harry’s first thought was that this \\nwas not someone to cross. \\n\\n“the firs’ years, professor mcgonagall,” said hagrid. \\n\\n“thank you, hagrid. i will take them from here.” \\n\\nshe pulled the door wide. the entrance hall was so \\nbig you could have fit the whole of the dursleys’ \\nhouse in it. the stone walls were lit with flaming \\ntorches like the ones at gringotts, the ceiling was too \\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase \\nfacing them led to the upper floors. \\n\\nthey followed professor mcgonagall across the \\nflagged stone floor. harry could hear the drone of \\nhundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the \\nrest of the school must already be here — but \\nprofessor mcgonagall showed the first years into a \\nsmall, empty chamber off the hall. they crowded in, \\npage | 127 \\n\\n\\n\\nstanding rather closer together than they would \\nusually have done, peering about nervously. \\n\\n“welcome to hogwarts,” said professor mcgonagall. \\n“the start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but \\nbefore you take your seats in the great hall, you will \\nbe sorted into your houses. the sorting is a very \\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here, \\nyour house will be something like your family within \\nhogwarts. you will have classes with the rest of your \\nhouse, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free \\ntime in your house common room. \\n\\n“the four houses are called gryffindor, hufflepuff, \\nravenclaw, and slytherin. each house has its own \\nnoble history and each has produced outstanding \\nwitches and wizards. while you are at hogwarts, your \\ntriumphs will earn your house points, while any rule- \\nbreaking will lose house points. at the end of the \\nyear, the house with the most points is awarded the \\nhouse cup, a great honor. i hope each of you will be a \\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours. \\n\\n“the sorting ceremony will take place in a few \\nminutes in front of the rest of the school. i suggest \\nyou all smarten yourselves up as much as you can \\nwhile you are waiting.” \\n\\nher eyes lingered for a moment on neville’s cloak, \\nwhich was fastened under his left ear, and on ron’s \\nsmudged nose. harry nervously tried to flatten his \\nhair. \\n\\n“i shall return when we are ready for you,” said \\nprofessor mcgonagall. “please wait quietly.” \\n\\nshe left the chamber. harry swallowed. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 128 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“how exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked \\nron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“some sort of test, i think. fred said it hurts a lot, but \\ni think he was joking.” \\n\\nharry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. a test? in front of \\nthe whole school? but he didn’t know any magic yet \\n— what on earth would he have to do? he hadn’t \\nexpected something like this the moment they \\narrived. he looked around anxiously and saw that \\neveryone else looked terrified, too. no one was talking \\nmuch except hermione granger, who was whispering \\nvery fast about all the spells she’d learned and \\nwondering which one she’d need. harry tried hard not \\nto listen to her. he’d never been more nervous, never, \\nnot even when he’d had to take a school report home \\nto the dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his \\nteachers wig blue. he kept his eyes fixed on the door. \\nany second now, professor mcgonagall would come \\nback and lead him to his doom. \\n\\nthen something happened that made him jump about \\na foot in the air — several people behind him \\nscreamed. \\n\\n“what the — ?” \\n\\nhe gasped. so did the people around him. about \\ntwenty ghosts had just streamed through the back \\nwall. pearly-white and slightly transparent, they \\nglided across the room talking to one another and \\nhardly glancing at the first years. they seemed to be \\narguing. what looked like a fat little monk was \\nsaying: “forgive and forget, i say, we ought to give \\nhim a second chance — ” \\n\\n“my dear friar, haven’t we given peeves all the \\nchances he deserves? he gives us all a bad name and \\n\\npage | 129 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou know, he’s not really even a ghost — i say, what \\nare you all doing here?” \\n\\n\\n\\na ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly \\nnoticed the first years. \\n\\nnobody answered. \\n\\n“new students!” said the fat friar, smiling around at \\nthem. “about to be sorted, i suppose?” \\n\\na few people nodded mutely. \\n\\n“hope to see you in hufflepuff!” said the friar. “my old \\nhouse, you know.” \\n\\n“move along now,” said a sharp voice. “the sorting \\nceremony’s about to start.” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall had returned. one by one, the \\nghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \\n\\n“now, form a line,” professor mcgonagall told the first \\nyears, “and follow me.” \\n\\nfeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, \\nharry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with \\nron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, \\nback across the hall, and through a pair of double \\ndoors into the great hall. \\n\\nharry had never even imagined such a strange and \\nsplendid place. it was lit by thousands and thousands \\nof candles that were floating in midair over four long \\ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting. \\nthese tables were laid with glittering golden plates \\nand goblets. at the top of the hall was another long \\ntable where the teachers were sitting. professor \\nmcgonagall led the first years up here, so that they \\npage | 130 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncame to a halt in a line facing the other students, \\nwith the teachers behind them. the hundreds of faces \\nstaring at them looked like pale lanterns in the \\nflickering candlelight. dotted here and there among \\nthe students, the ghosts shone misty silver. mainly to \\navoid all the staring eyes, harry looked upward and \\nsaw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. he heard \\nhermione whisper, “it’s bewitched to look like the sky \\noutside. i read about it in hogwarts, a history.” \\n\\nit was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, \\nand that the great hall didn’t simply open on to the \\nheavens. \\n\\nharry quickly looked down again as professor \\nmcgonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front \\nof the first years. on top of the stool she put a pointed \\nwizard’s hat. this hat was patched and frayed and \\nextremely dirty. aunt petunia wouldn’t have let it in \\nthe house. \\n\\nmaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, harry \\nthought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — \\nnoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at \\nthe hat, he stared at it, too. for a few seconds, there \\nwas complete silence. then the hat twitched. a rip \\nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the \\nhat began to sing: \\n\\n“oh, you may not think i’m pretty, \\n\\nbut don’t judge on what you see, \\n\\ni’ll eat myself if you can find \\n\\na smarter hat than me. \\n\\nyou can keep your bowlers black, \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 131 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour top hats sleek and tall, \\n\\nfor i’m the hogwarts sorting hat \\nand i can cap them all. \\n\\nthere’s nothing hidden in your head \\nthe sorting hat can’t see, \\n\\nso try me on and i will tell you \\nwhere you ought to be. \\n\\nyou might belong in gryffindor, \\n\\nwhere dwell the brave at heart, \\n\\ntheir daring, nerve, and chivalry \\nset gryffindors apart; \\n\\nyou might belong in hufflepuff, \\n\\nwhere they are just and loyal, \\n\\nthose patient hufflepuffs are true \\nand unafraid of toil; \\n\\nor yet in wise old ravenclaw, \\n\\nif you’ve a ready mind, \\n\\nwhere those of wit and learning, \\n\\nwill always find their kind; \\n\\nor perhaps in slytherin \\n\\npage | 132 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou’ll make your real friends, \\n\\nthose cunning folk use any means \\nto achieve their ends. \\n\\nso put me on! don’t be afraid l\\\\ \\n\\nand don’t get in a flap\\\\ \\n\\nyou’re in safe hands (though i have none) \\n\\nfor i’m a thinking cap\\\\” \\n\\nthe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished \\nits song. it bowed to each of the four tables and then \\nbecame quite still again. \\n\\n“so we’ve just got to try on the hat!” ron whispered to \\nharry. “i’ll kill fred, he was going on about wrestling \\na troll.” \\n\\nharry smiled weakly. yes, trying on the hat was a lot \\nbetter than having to do a spell, but he did wish they \\ncould have tried it on without everyone watching. the \\nhat seemed to be asking rather a lot; harry didn’t feel \\nbrave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. if \\nonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who \\nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for \\nhim. \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a \\nlong roll of parchment. \\n\\n“when i call your name, you will put on the hat and \\nsit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “abbott, \\nhannah!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 133 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of \\nline, put on the hat, which fell right down over her \\neyes, and sat down. a moment’s pause — \\n\\n“hufflepuff!” shouted the hat. \\n\\nthe table on the right cheered and clapped as \\nhannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table. \\n\\nharry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at \\nher. \\n\\n“bones, susan!” \\n\\n“hufflepuff!” shouted the hat again, and susan \\nscuttled off to sit next to hannah. \\n\\n“boot, terry!” \\n\\n“ravenclaw!” \\n\\nthe table second from the left clapped this time; \\nseveral ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with \\nterry as he joined them. \\n\\n“brocklehurst, mandy” went to ravenclaw too, but \\n“brown, lavender” became the first new gryffindor, \\nand the table on the far left exploded with cheers; \\nharry could see ron’s twin brothers catcalling. \\n\\n“bulstrode, millicent” then became a slytherin. \\nperhaps it was harry’s imagination, after all he’d \\nheard about slytherin, but he thought they looked \\nlike an unpleasant lot. \\n\\nhe was starting to feel definitely sick now. he \\nremembered being picked for teams during gym at his \\nold school. he had always been last to be chosen, not \\nbecause he was no good, but because no one wanted \\ndudley to think they liked him. \\n\\npage | 134 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“finch-fletchley, justin!” \\n\\n\\n\\n“hufflepuff!” \\n\\nsometimes, harry noticed, the hat shouted out the \\nhouse at once, but at others it took a little while to \\ndecide. “finnigan, seamus,” the sandy-haired boy \\nnext to harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a \\nwhole minute before the hat declared him a \\ngryffindor. \\n\\n“granger, hermione!” \\n\\nhermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat \\neagerly on her head. \\n\\n“gryffindor!” shouted the hat. ron groaned. \\n\\na horrible thought struck harry, as horrible thoughts \\nalways do when you’re very nervous. what if he \\nwasn’t chosen at all? what if he just sat there with \\nthe hat over his eyes for ages, until professor \\nmcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had \\nobviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on \\nthe train? \\n\\nwhen neville longbottom, the boy who kept losing his \\ntoad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. \\nthe hat took a long time to decide with neville. when \\nit finally shouted, “gryffindor,” neville ran off still \\nwearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter \\nto give it to “macdougal, morag.” \\n\\nmalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called \\nand got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched \\nhis head when it screamed, “slytherin!” \\n\\nmalfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle, \\nlooking pleased with himself. \\n\\npage | 135 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere weren’t many people left now. \\n\\n\\n\\n“moon” , “nott” ... , “parkinson” ... , then a pair of \\ntwin girls, “path” and “path” ... , then “perks, sally- \\nanne” . . . , and then, at last — \\n\\n“potter, harry!” \\n\\nas harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke \\nout like little hissing fires all over the hall. \\n\\n“ potter , did she say?” \\n\\n“ the harry potter?” \\n\\nthe last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over \\nhis eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a \\ngood look at him. next second he was looking at the \\nblack inside of the hat. he waited. \\n\\n“hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “difficult. very \\ndifficult. plenty of courage, i see. not a bad mind \\neither. there’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a \\nnice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... \\nso where shall i put you?” \\n\\nharry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, not \\nslytherin, not slytherin. \\n\\n“not slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “are you \\nsure? you could be great, you know, it’s all here in \\nyour head, and slytherin will help you on the way to \\ngreatness, no doubt about that — no? well, if you’re \\nsure — better be gryffindor!” \\n\\nharry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole \\nhall. he took off the hat and walked shakily toward \\nthe gryffindor table. he was so relieved to have been \\nchosen and not put in slytherin, he hardly noticed \\n\\npage | 136 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet. percy the \\nprefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while \\nthe weasley twins yelled, “we got potter! we got \\npotter!” harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff \\nhe’d seen earlier. the ghost patted his arm, giving \\nharry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it \\ninto a bucket of ice-cold water. \\n\\nhe could see the high table properly now. at the end \\nnearest him sat hagrid, who caught his eye and gave \\nhim the thumbs up. harry grinned back. and there, \\nin the center of the high table, in a large gold chair, \\nsat albus dumbledore. harry recognized him at once \\nfrom the card he’d gotten out of the chocolate frog on \\nthe train. dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing \\nin the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. \\nharry spotted professor quirrell, too, the nervous \\nyoung man from the leaky cauldron. he was looking \\nvery peculiar in a large purple turban. \\n\\nand now there were only four people left to be sorted. \\n“thomas, dean,” a black boy even taller than ron, \\njoined harry at the gryffindor table. “turpin, lisa,” \\nbecame a ravenclaw and then it was ron’s turn. he \\nwas pale green by now. harry crossed his fingers \\nunder the table and a second later the hat had \\nshouted, “gryffindor!” \\n\\nharry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed \\ninto the chair next to him. \\n\\n“well done, ron, excellent,” said percy weasley \\npompously across harry as “zabini, blaise,” was \\nmade a slytherin. professor mcgonagall rolled up her \\nscroll and took the sorting hat away. \\n\\nharry looked down at his empty gold plate. he had \\nonly just realized how hungry he was. the pumpkin \\npasties seemed ages ago. \\n\\npage | 137 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalbus dumbledore had gotten to his feet. he was \\nbeaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if \\nnothing could have pleased him more than to see \\nthem all there. \\n\\n“welcome!” he said. “welcome to a new year at \\nhogwarts! before we begin our banquet, i would like \\nto say a few words. and here they are: nitwit! \\n\\nblubber! oddment! tweak! \\n\\n“thank you!” \\n\\nhe sat back down. everybody clapped and cheered. \\nharry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. \\n\\n“is he — a bit mad?” he asked percy uncertainly. \\n\\n“mad?” said percy airily. “he’s a genius! best wizard \\nin the world! but he is a bit mad, yes. potatoes, \\nharry?” \\n\\nharry’s mouth fell open. the dishes in front of him \\nwere now piled with food. he had never seen so many \\nthings he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast \\nchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, \\nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \\nfries, yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, \\nketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint \\nhumbugs. \\n\\nthe dursleys had never exactly starved harry, but \\nhe’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. \\ndudley had always taken anything that harry really \\nwanted, even if it made him sick. harry piled his plate \\nwith a bit of everything except the peppermints and \\nbegan to eat. it was all delicious. \\n\\n“that does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, \\nwatching harry cut up his steak. \\n\\npage | 138 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“can’t you — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“i haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said \\nthe ghost. “i don’t need to, of course, but one does \\nmiss it. i don’t think i’ve introduced myself? sir \\nnicholas de mimsy-porpington at your service. \\nresident ghost of gryffindor tower.” \\n\\n“i know who you are!” said ron suddenly. “my \\nbrothers told me about you — you’re nearly headless \\nnick!” \\n\\n“i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy \\n— ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired seamus \\nfinnigan interrupted. \\n\\n“nearly headless? how can you be nearly headless?” \\n\\nsir nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little \\nchat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted. \\n\\n“like this,” he said irritably. he seized his left ear and \\npulled. his whole head swung off his neck and fell \\nonto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. someone \\nhad obviously tried to behead him, but not done it \\nproperly. looking pleased at the stunned looks on \\ntheir faces, nearly headless nick flipped his head \\nback onto his neck, coughed, and said, “so — new \\ngryffindors! i hope you’re going to help us win the \\nhouse championship this year? gryffindors have \\nnever gone so long without winning. slytherins have \\ngot the cup six years in a row! the bloody baron’s \\nbecoming almost unbearable — he’s the slytherin \\nghost.” \\n\\nharry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a \\nhorrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a \\ngaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. he \\nwas right next to malfoy who, harry was pleased to \\n\\npage | 139 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsee, didn’t look too pleased with the seating \\narrangements. \\n\\n“how did he get covered in blood?” asked seamus \\nwith great interest. \\n\\n“i’ve never asked,” said nearly headless nick \\ndelicately. \\n\\nwhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the \\nremains of the food faded from the plates, leaving \\nthem sparkling clean as before. a moment later the \\ndesserts appeared. blocks of ice cream in every flavor \\nyou could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate \\neclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jell- \\n0, rice pudding ... \\n\\nas harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk \\nturned to their families. \\n\\n“i’m half-and-half,” said seamus. “me dad’s a muggle. \\nmom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they \\nwere married. bit of a nasty shock for him.” \\n\\nthe others laughed. \\n\\n“what about you, neville?” said ron. \\n\\n“well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” \\nsaid neville, “but the family thought i was all- muggle \\nfor ages. my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me \\noff my guard and force some magic out of me — he \\npushed me off the end of blackpool pier once, i nearly \\ndrowned — but nothing happened until i was eight. \\ngreat uncle algie came round for dinner, and he was \\nhanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles \\nwhen my great auntie enid offered him a meringue \\nand he accidentally let go. but i bounced — all the \\nway down the garden and into the road. they were all \\npage | 140 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreally pleased, gran was crying, she was so happy. \\nand you should have seen their faces when i got in \\nhere — they thought i might not be magic enough to \\ncome, you see. great uncle algie was so pleased he \\nbought me my toad.” \\n\\non harry’s other side, percy weasley and hermione \\nwere talking about lessons (“i do hope they start right \\naway, there’s so much to learn, i’m particularly \\ninterested in transfiguration, you know, turning \\nsomething into something else, of course, it’s \\nsupposed to be very difficult — “you’ll be starting \\nsmall, just matches into needles and that sort of \\nthing — ”). \\n\\n\\n\\nharry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, \\nlooked up at the high table again. hagrid was \\ndrinking deeply from his goblet. professor mcgonagall \\nwas talking to professor dumbledore. professor \\nquirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a \\nteacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and \\nsallow skin. \\n\\nit happened very suddenly. the hook-nosed teacher \\nlooked past quirrell’s turban straight into harry’s \\neyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on \\nharry’s forehead. \\n\\n“ouch!” harry clapped a hand to his head. \\n\\n“what is it?” asked percy. \\n\\n“n-nothing.” \\n\\nthe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. harder \\nto shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the \\nteacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like harry at \\nall. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 141 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“who’s that teacher talking to professor quirrell?” he \\nasked percy. \\n\\n“oh, you know quirrell already, do you? no wonder \\nhe’s looking so nervous, that’s professor snape. he \\nteaches potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone \\nknows he’s after quirrell’s job. knows an awful lot \\nabout the dark arts, snape.” \\n\\nharry watched snape for a while, but snape didn’t \\nlook at him again. \\n\\nat last, the desserts too disappeared, and professor \\ndumbledore got to his feet again. the hall fell silent. \\n\\n“ahem — just a few more words now that we are all \\nfed and watered. i have a few start-of-term notices to \\ngive you. \\n\\n“first years should note that the forest on the \\ngrounds is forbidden to all pupils. and a few of our \\nolder students would do well to remember that as \\nwell.” \\n\\ndumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction \\nof the weasley twins. \\n\\n“i have also been asked by mr. filch, the caretaker, to \\nremind you all that no magic should be used between \\nclasses in the corridors. \\n\\n“quidditch trials will be held in the second week of \\nthe term. anyone interested in playing for their house \\nteams should contact madam hooch. \\n\\n“and finally, i must tell you that this year, the third- \\nfloor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds \\nto everyone who does not wish to die a very painful \\ndeath.” \\n\\npage | 142 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \\n\\n\\n\\n“he’s not serious?” he muttered to percy. \\n\\n“must be,” said percy, frowning at dumbledore. “it’s \\nodd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re \\nnot allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of \\ndangerous beasts, everyone knows that. i do think he \\nmight have told us prefects, at least.” \\n\\n“and now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school \\nsong!” cried dumbledore. harry noticed that the other \\nteachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. \\n\\ndumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was \\ntrying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden \\nribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables \\nand twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \\n\\n“everyone pick their favorite tune,” said dumbledore, \\n“and off we go!” \\n\\nand the school bellowed: \\n\\n“hogwarts, hogwarts, hoggy warty hogwarts, \\n\\nteach us something please, \\n\\nwhether we be old and bald \\nor young with scabby knees, \\n\\nour heads could do with filling \\nwith some interesting stuff, \\n\\nfor now they’re bare and full of air, \\n\\ndead flies and bits of fluff, \\n\\npage | 143 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nso teach us things worth knowing, \\n\\nbring back what we’ve forgot, \\n\\njust do your best, we’ll do the rest, \\n\\nand learn until our brains all rot.” \\n\\neverybody finished the song at different times. at last, \\nonly the weasley twins were left singing along to a \\nvery slow funeral march. dumbledore conducted their \\nlast few lines with his wand and when they had \\nfinished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \\n\\n“ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “a magic \\nbeyond all we do here! and now, bedtime. off you \\ntrot!” \\n\\nthe gryffindor first years followed percy through the \\nchattering crowds, out of the great hall, and up the \\nmarble staircase. harry’s legs were like lead again, \\nbut only because he was so tired and full of food. he \\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in \\nthe portraits along the corridors whispered and \\npointed as they passed, or that twice percy led them \\nthrough doorways hidden behind sliding panels and \\nhanging tapestries. they climbed more staircases, \\nyawning and dragging their feet, and harry was just \\nwondering how much farther they had to go when \\nthey came to a sudden halt. \\n\\na bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair \\nahead of them, and as percy took a step toward them \\nthey started throwing themselves at him. \\n\\n“peeves,” percy whispered to the first years. “a \\npoltergeist.” he raised his voice, “peeves — show \\nyourself.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 144 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a \\nballoon, answered. \\n\\n“do you want me to go to the bloody baron?” \\n\\nthere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark \\neyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- \\nlegged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \\n\\n“oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “ickle \\nfirsties! what fun!” \\n\\nhe swooped suddenly at them. they all ducked. \\n\\n“go away, peeves, or the baron’ll hear about this, i \\nmean it!” barked percy. \\n\\npeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping \\nthe walking sticks on neville’s head. they heard him \\nzooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \\n\\n“you want to watch out for peeves,” said percy, as \\nthey set off again. “the bloody baron’s the only one \\nwho can control him, he won’t even listen to us \\nprefects. here we are.” \\n\\nat the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a \\nvery fat woman in a pink silk dress. \\n\\n“password?” she said. \\n\\n“caput draconis,” said percy, and the portrait swung \\nforward to reveal a round hole in the wall. they all \\nscrambled through it — neville needed a leg up — \\nand found themselves in the gryffindor common \\nroom, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \\n\\npercy directed the girls through one door to their \\ndormitory and the boys through another. at the top of \\n\\npage | 145 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the \\ntowers — they found their beds at last: five four- \\nposters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. their \\ntrunks had already been brought up. too tired to talk \\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \\n\\n“great food, isn’t it?” ron muttered to harry through \\nthe hangings. “get off scabbers! he’s chewing my \\nsheets.” \\n\\nharry was going to ask ron if he’d had any of the \\ntreacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. \\n\\nperhaps harry had eaten a bit too much, because he \\nhad a very strange dream. he was wearing professor \\nquirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling \\nhim he must transfer to slytherin at once, because it \\nwas his destiny. harry told the turban he didn’t want \\nto be in slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried \\nto pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there \\nwas malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — \\nthen malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, \\nsnape, whose laugh became high and cold — there \\nwas a burst of green light and harry woke, sweating \\nand shaking. \\n\\nhe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he \\nwoke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 146 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe potions master \\n\\n“there, look.” \\n\\n“where?” \\n\\n“next to the tall kid with the red hair.” \\n\\n“wearing the glasses?” \\n\\n“did you see his face?” \\n\\n“did you see his scar?” \\n\\nwhispers followed harry from the moment he left his \\ndormitory the next day. people lining up outside \\nclassrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or \\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again, \\nstaring. harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was \\ntrying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. \\n\\nthere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at \\nhogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; \\nsome that led somewhere different on a friday; some \\n\\npage | 147 \\n\\n\\n\\nwith a vanishing step halfway up that you had to \\nremember to jump. then there were doors that \\nwouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled \\nthem in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t \\nreally doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. it \\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was, \\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. the \\npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each other, \\nand harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \\n\\nthe ghosts didn’t help, either. it was always a nasty \\nshock when one of them glided suddenly through a \\ndoor you were trying to open. nearly headless nick \\nwas always happy to point new gryffindors in the \\nright direction, but peeves the poltergeist was worth \\ntwo locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him \\nwhen you were late for class. he would drop \\nwastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from \\nunder your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak \\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\n“got your conk!” \\n\\neven worse than peeves, if that was possible, was the \\ncaretaker, argus filch. harry and ron managed to get \\non the wrong side of him on their very first morning. \\nfilch found them trying to force their way through a \\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to \\nthe out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. he \\nwouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were \\ntrying to break into it on purpose, and was \\nthreatening to lock them in the dungeons when they \\nwere rescued by professor quirrell, who was passing. \\n\\nfilch owned a cat called mrs. norris, a scrawny, dust- \\ncolored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like \\nfilch’s. she patrolled the corridors alone. break a rule \\nin front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d \\nwhisk off for filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two \\nseconds later. filch knew the secret passageways of \\npage | 148 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe school better than anyone (except perhaps the \\nweasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any \\nof the ghosts. the students all hated him, and it was \\nthe dearest ambition of many to give mrs. norris a \\ngood kick. \\n\\nand then, once you had managed to find them, there \\nwere the classes themselves. there was a lot more to \\nmagic, as harry quickly found out, than waving your \\nwand and saying a few funny words. \\n\\nthey had to study the night skies through their \\ntelescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn \\nthe names of different stars and the movements of the \\nplanets. three times a week they went out to the \\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study herbology, \\nwith a dumpy little witch called professor sprout, \\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange \\nplants and fungi, and found out what they were used \\nfor. \\n\\neasily the most boring class was history of magic, \\nwhich was the only one taught by a ghost. professor \\nbinns had been very old indeed when he had fallen \\nasleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next \\nmorning to teach, leaving his body behind him. binns \\ndroned on and on while they scribbled down names \\nand dates, and got emeric the evil and uric the \\noddball mixed up. \\n\\nprofessor flitwick, the charms teacher, was a tiny \\nlittle wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to \\nsee over his desk. at the start of their first class he \\ntook the roll call, and when he reached harry’s name \\nhe gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall was again different. harry had \\nbeen quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 149 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncross. strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to \\nthe moment they sat down in her first class. \\n\\n“transfiguration is some of the most complex and \\ndangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts,” she \\nsaid. “anyone messing around in my class will leave \\nand not come back. you have been warned.” \\n\\nthen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. \\nthey were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get \\nstarted, but soon realized they weren’t going to be \\nchanging the furniture into animals for a long time. \\nafter taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each \\ngiven a match and started trying to turn it into a \\nneedle. by the end of the lesson, only hermione \\ngranger had made any difference to her match; \\nprofessor mcgonagall showed the class how it had \\ngone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare \\nsmile. \\n\\nthe class everyone had really been looking forward to \\nwas defense against the dark arts, but quirrell’s \\nlessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. his classroom \\nsmelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to \\nward off a vampire he’d met in romania and was \\nafraid would be coming back to get him one of these \\ndays. his turban, he told them, had been given to him \\nby an african prince as a thank-you for getting rid of \\na troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they \\nbelieved this story. for one thing, when seamus \\nfinnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had \\nfought off the zombie, quirrell went pink and started \\ntalking about the weather; for another, they had \\nnoticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, \\nand the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full \\nof garlic as well, so that quirrell was protected \\nwherever he went. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 150 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t \\nmiles behind everyone else. lots of people had come \\nfrom muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any \\nidea that they were witches and wizards. there was so \\nmuch to learn that even people like ron didn’t have \\nmuch of a head start. \\n\\nfriday was an important day for harry and ron. they \\nfinally managed to find their way down to the great \\nhall for breakfast without getting lost once. \\n\\n“what have we got today?” harry asked ron as he \\npoured sugar on his porridge. \\n\\n“double potions with the slytherins,” said ron. \\n“snape’s head of slytherin house. they say he always \\nfavors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” \\n\\n“wish mcgonagall favored us,” said harry. professor \\nmcgonagall was head of gryffindor house, but it \\nhadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of \\nhomework the day before. \\n\\njust then, the mail arrived. harry had gotten used to \\nthis by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on \\nthe first morning, when about a hundred owls had \\nsuddenly streamed into the great hall during \\nbreakfast, circling the tables until they saw their \\nowners, and dropping letters and packages onto their \\nlaps. \\n\\nhedwig hadn’t brought harry anything so far. she \\nsometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of \\ntoast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the \\nother school owls. this morning, however, she \\nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar \\nbowl and dropped a note onto harry’s plate. harry \\ntore it open at once. it said, in a very untidy scrawl: \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 151 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndear harry, \\n\\n\\n\\ni know you get friday afternoons off so would you like \\nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three? \\n\\ni want to hear all about your first week. send us an \\nanswer back with hedwig. \\n\\nhagrid \\n\\nharry borrowed ron’s quill, scribbled yes, please, see \\nyou later on the back of the note, and sent hedwig off \\nagain. \\n\\nit was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look \\nforward to, because the potions lesson turned out to \\nbe the worst thing that had happened to him so far. \\n\\nat the start-of-term banquet, harry had gotten the \\nidea that professor snape disliked him. by the end of \\nthe first potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. \\nsnape didn’t dislike harry — he hated him. \\n\\npotions lessons took place down in one of the \\ndungeons. it was colder here than up in the main \\ncastle, and would have been quite creepy enough \\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all \\naround the walls. \\n\\nsnape, like flitwick, started the class by taking the \\nroll call, and like flitwick, he paused at harry’s name. \\n\\n“ah, yes,” he said softly, “harry potter. our new — \\ncelebrity.” \\n\\ndraco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle \\nsniggered behind their hands. snape finished calling \\nthe names and looked up at the class. his eyes were \\nblack like hagrid ’s, but they had none of hagrid ’s \\n\\npage | 152 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwarmth. they were cold and empty and made you \\nthink of dark tunnels. \\n\\n“you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art \\nof potion-making,” he began. he spoke in barely more \\nthan a whisper, but they caught every word — like \\nprofessor mcgonagall, snape had the gift of keeping a \\nclass silent without effort. “as there is little foolish \\nwand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe \\nthis is magic. i don’t expect you will really understand \\nthe beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its \\nshimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that \\ncreep through human veins, bewitching the mind, \\nensnaring the senses. ... i can teach you how to bottle \\nfame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t \\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to \\nteach.” \\n\\nmore silence followed this little speech. harry and \\nron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. hermione \\ngranger was on the edge of her seat and looked \\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn’t a \\ndunderhead. \\n\\n“potter!” said snape suddenly. “what would i get if i \\nadded powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of \\nwormwood?” \\n\\npowdered root of what to an infusion of what? harry \\nglanced at ron, who looked as stumped as he was; \\nhermione ’s hand had shot into the air. \\n\\n“i don’t know, sir,” said harry. \\n\\nsnape ’s lips curled into a sneer. \\n\\n“tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” \\n\\nhe ignored hermione ’s hand. \\n\\npage | 153 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“let’s try again. potter, where would you look if i told \\nyou to find me a bezoar?” \\n\\nhermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it \\nwould go without her leaving her seat, but harry \\ndidn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. he \\ntried not to look at malfoy, crabbe, and goyle, who \\nwere shaking with laughter. \\n\\n“i don’t know, sir.” \\n\\n“thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, \\neh, potter?” \\n\\nharry forced himself to keep looking straight into \\nthose cold eyes. he had looked through his books at \\nthe dursleys’, but did snape expect him to remember \\neverything in one thousand magical herbs and \\nfungi ? \\n\\nsnape was still ignoring hermione’s quivering hand. \\n\\n“what is the difference, potter, between monkshood \\nand wolfsbane?” \\n\\nat this, hermione stood up, her hand stretching \\ntoward the dungeon ceiling. \\n\\n“i don’t know,” said harry quietly. “i think hermione \\ndoes, though, why don’t you try her?” \\n\\na few people laughed; harry caught seamus’s eye, \\nand seamus winked. snape, however, was not \\npleased. \\n\\n“sit down,” he snapped at hermione. “for your \\ninformation, potter, asphodel and wormwood make a \\nsleeping potion so powerful it is known as the \\ndraught of living death. a bezoar is a stone taken \\n\\npage | 154 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the stomach of a goat and it will save you from \\nmost poisons. as for monkshood and wolfsbane, they \\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of \\naconite. well? why aren’t you all copying that down?” \\n\\nthere was a sudden rummaging for quills and \\nparchment. over the noise, snape said, “and a point \\nwill be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek, \\npotter.” \\n\\nthings didn’t improve for the gryffindors as the \\npotions lesson continued. snape put them all into \\npairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to \\ncure boils. he swept around in his long black cloak, \\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake \\nfangs, criticizing almost everyone except malfoy, \\nwhom he seemed to like. he was just telling everyone \\nto look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his \\nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a \\nloud hissing filled the dungeon. neville had somehow \\nmanaged to melt seamus’s cauldron into a twisted \\nblob, and their potion was seeping across the stone \\nfloor, burning holes in people’s shoes. within \\nseconds, the whole class was standing on their stools \\nwhile neville, who had been drenched in the potion \\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as \\nangry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \\n\\n“idiot boy!” snarled snape, clearing the spilled potion \\naway with one wave of his wand. “i suppose you \\nadded the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron \\noff the fire?” \\n\\nneville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over \\nhis nose. \\n\\n“take him up to the hospital wing,” snape spat at \\nseamus. then he rounded on harry and ron, who \\nhad been working next to neville. \\n\\npage | 155 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you — potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add \\nthe quills? thought he’d make you look good if he got \\nit wrong, did you? that’s another point you’ve lost for \\ngryffindor.” \\n\\nthis was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to \\nargue, but ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \\n\\n“don’t push it,” he muttered, “i’ve heard snape can \\nturn very nasty.” \\n\\nas they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour \\nlater, harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were \\nlow. he’d lost two points for gryffindor in his very \\nfirst week — why did snape hate him so much? \\n\\n“cheer up,” said ron, “snape’s always taking points \\noff fred and george. can i come and meet hagrid \\nwith you?” \\n\\nat five to three they left the castle and made their way \\nacross the grounds. hagrid lived in a small wooden \\nhouse on the edge of the forbidden forest. a crossbow \\nand a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. \\n\\nwhen harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling \\nfrom inside and several booming barks. then hagrid ’s \\nvoice rang out, saying, “back, fang — back.” \\n\\nhagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he \\npulled the door open. \\n\\n“hang on,” he said. “back, fang.” \\n\\nhe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar \\nof an enormous black boarhound. \\n\\nthere was only one room inside. hams and pheasants \\nwere hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was \\n\\npage | 156 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nboiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a \\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \\n\\n“make yerselves at home,” said hagrid, letting go of \\nfang, who bounded straight at ron and started \\nlicking his ears. like hagrid, fang was clearly not as \\nfierce as he looked. \\n\\n“this is ron,” harry told hagrid, who was pouring \\nboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock \\ncakes onto a plate. \\n\\n“another weasley, eh?” said hagrid, glancing at ron’s \\nfreckles. “i spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers \\naway from the forest.” \\n\\nthe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins \\nthat almost broke their teeth, but harry and ron \\npretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all \\nabout their first lessons. fang rested his head on \\nharry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. \\n\\nharry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call \\nfilch “that old git.” \\n\\n“an’ as fer that cat, mrs. norris, i’d like ter introduce \\nher to fang sometime. d’yeh know, every time i go up \\nter the school, she follows me everywhere? can’t get \\nrid of her — filch puts her up to it.” \\n\\nharry told hagrid about snape’s lesson. hagrid, like \\nron, told harry not to worry about it, that snape \\nliked hardly any of the students. \\n\\n“but he seemed to really hate me.” \\n\\n“rubbish!” said hagrid. “why should he?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 157 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyet harry couldn’t help thinking that hagrid didn’t \\nquite meet his eyes when he said that. \\n\\n“how’s yer brother charlie?” hagrid asked ron. “i \\nliked him a lot — great with animals.” \\n\\nharry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on \\npurpose. while ron told hagrid all about charlie’s \\nwork with dragons, harry picked up a piece of paper \\nthat was lying on the table under the tea cozy. it was \\na cutting from the daily prophet : \\n\\ngringotts break-in latest \\n\\ninvestigations continue into the break-in at gringotts \\non 3 1 july, widely believed to be the work of dark \\nwizards or witches unknown. \\n\\ngringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had \\nbeen taken. the vault that was searched had in fact \\nbeen emptied the same day. \\n\\n“but we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep \\nyour noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said \\na gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. \\n\\nharry remembered ron telling him on the train that \\nsomeone had tried to rob gringotts, but ron hadn’t \\nmentioned the date. \\n\\n“hagrid!” said harry, “that gringotts break-in \\nhappened on my birthday! it might’ve been happening \\nwhile we were there!” \\n\\nthere was no doubt about it, hagrid definitely didn’t \\nmeet harry’s eyes this time. he grunted and offered \\nhim another rock cake. harry read the story again. \\n\\nthe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied \\nearlier that same day. hagrid had emptied vault seven \\npage | 158 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, \\ntaking out that grubby little package. had that been \\nwhat the thieves were looking for? \\n\\nas harry and ron walked back to the castle for \\ndinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes \\nthey’d been too polite to refuse, harry thought that \\nnone of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as \\nmuch to think about as tea with hagrid. had hagrid \\ncollected that package just in time? where was it \\nnow? and did hagrid know something about snape \\nthat he didn’t want to tell harry? \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 159 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe midnight duel \\n\\nharry had never believed he would meet a boy he \\nhated more than dudley, but that was before he met \\ndraco malfoy. still, first-year gryffindors only had \\npotions with the slytherins, so they didn’t have to put \\nup with malfoy much. or at least, they didn’t until \\nthey spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor \\ncommon room that made them all groan. flying \\nlessons would be starting on thursday — and \\ngryffindor and slytherin would be learning together. \\n\\n“typical,” said harry darkly. “just what i always \\nwanted. to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in \\nfront of malfoy.” \\n\\nhe had been looking forward to learning to fly more \\nthan anything else. \\n\\n“you don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” \\nsaid ron reasonably. “anyway, i know malfoy’s always \\ngoing on about how good he is at quidditch, but i bet \\nthat’s all talk.” \\n\\npage | 160 \\n\\n\\n\\nmalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. he \\ncomplained loudly about first years never getting on \\nthe house quidditch teams and told long, boastful \\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly \\nescaping muggles in helicopters. he wasn’t the only \\none, though: the way seamus finnigan told it, he’d \\nspent most of his childhood zooming around the \\ncountryside on his broomstick. even ron would tell \\nanyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a \\nhang glider on charlie’s old broom. everyone from \\nwizarding families talked about quidditch constantly. \\nron had already had a big argument with dean \\nthomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. \\nron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with \\nonly one ball where no one was allowed to fly. harry \\nhad caught ron prodding dean’s poster of west ham \\nsoccer team, trying to make the players move. \\n\\nneville had never been on a broomstick in his life, \\nbecause his grandmother had never let him near one. \\nprivately, harry felt she’d had good reason, because \\nneville managed to have an extraordinary number of \\naccidents even with both feet on the ground. \\n\\nhermione granger was almost as nervous about \\nflying as neville was. this was something you couldn’t \\nlearn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t \\ntried. at breakfast on thursday she bored them all \\nstupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library \\nbook called quidditch through the ages. neville was \\nhanging on to her every word, desperate for anything \\nthat might help him hang on to his broomstick later, \\nbut everybody else was very pleased when hermione ’s \\nlecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \\n\\nharry hadn’t had a single letter since hagrid’s note, \\nsomething that malfoy had been quick to notice, of \\ncourse. malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 161 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\npackages of sweets from home, which he opened \\ngloatingly at the slytherin table. \\n\\na barn owl brought neville a small package from his \\ngrandmother. he opened it excitedly and showed \\nthem a glass ball the size of a large marble, which \\nseemed to be full of white smoke. \\n\\n“it’s a remembrall!” he explained. “gran knows i \\nforget things — this tells you if there’s something \\nyou’ve forgotten to do. look, you hold it tight like this \\nand if it turns red — oh ...” his face fell, because the \\nremembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve \\nforgotten something ...” \\n\\nneville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten \\nwhen draco malfoy, who was passing the gryffindor \\ntable, snatched the remembrall out of his hand. \\n\\nharry and ron jumped to their feet. they were half \\nhoping for a reason to fight malfoy, but professor \\nmcgonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any \\nteacher in the school, was there in a flash. \\n\\n“what’s going on?” \\n\\n“malfoy’s got my remembrall, professor.” \\n\\nscowling, malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall \\nback on the table. \\n\\n“just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with \\ncrabbe and goyle behind him. \\n\\nat three-thirty that afternoon, harry, ron, and the \\nother gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto \\nthe grounds for their first flying lesson. it was a clear, \\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as \\nthey marched down the sloping lawns toward a \\npage | 162 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds \\nto the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying \\ndarkly in the distance. \\n\\nthe slytherins were already there, and so were twenty \\nbroomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. harry \\nhad heard fred and george weasley complain about \\nthe school brooms, saying that some of them started \\nto vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly \\nto the left. \\n\\ntheir teacher, madam hooch, arrived. she had short, \\ngray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \\n\\n“well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. \\n“everyone stand by a broomstick. come on, hurry \\nup.” \" \\n\\nharry glanced down at his broom. it was old and \\nsome of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \\n\\n“stick out your right hand over your broom,” called \\nmadam hooch at the front, “and say ‘up!’ ” \\n\\n“up!” everyone shouted. \\n\\nharry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it \\nwas one of the few that did. hermione granger’s had \\nsimply rolled over on the ground, and neville’s hadn’t \\nmoved at all. perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell \\nwhen you were afraid, thought harry; there was a \\nquaver in neville’s voice that said only too clearly that \\nhe wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \\n\\nmadam hooch then showed them how to mount their \\nbrooms without sliding off the end, and walked up \\nand down the rows correcting their grips. harry and \\nron were delighted when she told malfoy he’d been \\ndoing it wrong for years. \\n\\npage | 163 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“now, when i blow my whistle, you kick off from the \\nground, hard,” said madam hooch. “keep your \\nbrooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight \\nback down by leaning forward slightly. on my whistle \\n— three — two — ” \\n\\nbut neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of \\nbeing left on the ground, pushed off hard before the \\nwhistle had touched madam hooch’s lips. \\n\\n“come back, boy!” she shouted, but neville was rising \\nstraight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve \\nfeet — twenty feet. harry saw his scared white face \\nlook down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, \\nslip sideways off the broom and — \\n\\nwham — a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay \\nfacedown on the grass in a heap. his broomstick was \\nstill rising higher and higher, and started to drift \\nlazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. \\n\\nmadam hooch was bending over neville, her face as \\nwhite as his. \\n\\n“broken wrist,” harry heard her mutter. “come on, \\nboy — it’s all right, up you get.” \\n\\nshe turned to the rest of the class. \\n\\n“none of you is to move while i take this boy to the \\nhospital wing! you leave those brooms where they are \\nor you’ll be out of hogwarts before you can say \\n‘quidditch.’ come on, dear.” \\n\\nneville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, \\nhobbled off with madam hooch, who had her arm \\naround him. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 164 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nno sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst \\ninto laughter. \\n\\n“did you see his face, the great lump?” \\n\\nthe other slytherins joined in. \\n\\n“shut up, malfoy,” snapped parvati patil. \\n\\n“ooh, sticking up for longbottom?” said pansy \\nparkinson, a hard-faced slytherin girl. “never thought \\nyou’d like fat little crybabies, parvati.” \\n\\n“look!” said malfoy, darting forward and snatching \\nsomething out of the grass. “it’s that stupid thing \\nlongbottom’s gran sent him.” \\n\\nthe remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \\n\\n“give that here, malfoy,” said harry quietly. everyone \\nstopped talking to watch. \\n\\nmalfoy smiled nastily. \\n\\n“i think i’ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find \\n— how about — up a tree?” \\n\\n“give it here!” harry yelled, but malfoy had leapt onto \\nhis broomstick and taken off. he hadn’t been lying, he \\ncould fly well. hovering level with the topmost \\nbranches of an oak he called, “come and get it, \\npotter!” \\n\\nharry grabbed his broom. \\n\\n“ivo!” shouted hermione granger. “madam hooch told \\nus not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 165 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry ignored her. blood was pounding in his ears. \\n\\nhe mounted the broom and kicked hard against the \\nground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his \\nhair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in \\na rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something \\nhe could do without being taught — this was easy, \\nthis was wonderful. he pulled his broomstick up a \\nlittle to take it even higher, and heard screams and \\ngasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring \\nwhoop from ron. \\n\\nhe turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in \\nmidair. malfoy looked stunned. \\n\\n“give it here,” harry called, “or i’ll knock you off that \\nbroom!” \\n\\n“oh, yeah?” said malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking \\nworried. \\n\\nharry knew, somehow, what to do. he leaned forward \\nand grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it \\nshot toward malfoy like a javelin. malfoy only just got \\nout of the way in time; harry made a sharp about- \\nface and held the broom steady. a few people below \\nwere clapping. \\n\\n“no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck, \\nmalfoy,” harry called. \\n\\nthe same thought seemed to have struck malfoy. \\n\\n“catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw \\nthe glass ball high into the air and streaked back \\ntoward the ground. \\n\\nharry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up \\nin the air and then start to fall. he leaned forward \\nand pointed his broom handle down — next second \\n\\npage | 166 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball \\n— wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the \\nscreams of people watching — he stretched out his \\nhand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in \\ntime to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently \\nonto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in \\nhis fist. \\n\\n“harry potter!” \\n\\nhis heart sank faster than he’d just dived. professor \\nmcgonagall was running toward them. he got to his \\nfeet, trembling. \\n\\n“never — in all my time at hogwarts — ” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall was almost speechless with \\nshock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “ — how dare \\nyou — might have broken your neck — ” \\n\\n“it wasn’t his fault, professor — ” \\n\\n“be quiet, miss patil — ” \\n\\n“but malfoy — ” \\n\\n“that’s enough, mr. weasley. potter, follow me, now.” \\n\\nharry caught sight of malfoy, crabbe, and goyle’s \\ntriumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in \\nprofessor mcgonagall’s wake as she strode toward the \\ncastle. he was going to be expelled, he just knew it. \\n\\nhe wanted to say something to defend himself, but \\nthere seemed to be something wrong with his voice. \\nprofessor mcgonagall was sweeping along without \\neven looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. now \\nhe’d done it. he hadn’t even lasted two weeks. he’d be \\npacking his bags in ten minutes. what would the \\ndursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \\npage | 167 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, \\nand still professor mcgonagall didn’t say a word to \\nhim. she wrenched open doors and marched along \\ncorridors with harry trotting miserably behind her. \\nmaybe she was taking him to dumbledore. he \\nthought of hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as \\ngamekeeper. perhaps he could be hagrid’s assistant. \\nhis stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching ron \\nand the others becoming wizards while he stumped \\naround the grounds carrying hagrid’s bag. \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom. \\nshe opened the door and poked her head inside. \\n\\n“excuse me, professor flitwick, could i borrow wood \\nfor a moment?” \\n\\nwood? thought harry, bewildered; was wood a cane \\nshe was going to use on him? \\n\\nbut wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year \\nboy who came out of flitwick’s class looking \\nconfused. \\n\\n“follow me, you two,” said professor mcgonagall, and \\nthey marched on up the corridor, wood looking \\ncuriously at harry. \\n\\n“in here.” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom \\nthat was empty except for peeves, who was busy \\nwriting rude words on the blackboard. \\n\\n“out, peeves!” she barked. peeves threw the chalk \\ninto a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out \\ncursing. professor mcgonagall slammed the door \\nbehind him and turned to face the two boys. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 168 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“potter, this is oliver wood. wood — i’ve found you a \\nseeker.” \\n\\nwood’s expression changed from puzzlement to \\ndelight. \\n\\n“are you serious, professor?” \\n\\n“absolutely,” said professor mcgonagall crisply. “the \\nboy’s a natural. i’ve never seen anything like it. was \\nthat your first time on a broomstick, potter?” \\n\\nharry nodded silently. he didn’t have a clue what was \\ngoing on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and \\nsome of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \\n\\n“he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot \\ndive,” professor mcgonagall told wood. “didn’t even \\nscratch himself. charlie weasley couldn’t have done \\nit.” \\n\\nwood was now looking as though all his dreams had \\ncome true at once. \\n\\n“ever seen a game of quidditch, potter?” he asked \\nexcitedly. \\n\\n“wood’s captain of the gryffindor team,” professor \\nmcgonagall explained. \\n\\n“he’s just the build for a seeker, too,” said wood, now \\nwalking around harry and staring at him. “light — \\nspeedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, \\nprofessor — a nimbus two thousand or a \\ncleansweep seven, i’d say.” \\n\\n“i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we \\ncan’t bend the first-year rule. heaven knows, we need \\na better team than last year. flattened in that last \\n\\npage | 169 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmatch by slytherin, i couldn’t look severus snape in \\nthe face for weeks. ...” \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses \\nat harry. \\n\\n“i want to hear you’re training hard, potter, or i may \\nchange my mind about punishing you.” \\n\\nthen she suddenly smiled. \\n\\n“your father would have been proud,” she said. “he \\nwas an excellent quidditch player himself.” \\n\\n“you’re joking.” \\n\\nit was dinnertime. harry had just finished telling ron \\nwhat had happened when he’d left the grounds with \\nprofessor mcgonagall. ron had a piece of steak and \\nkidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all \\nabout it. \\n\\n“seeker?” he said. “but first years never — you must \\nbe the youngest house player in about — ” \\n\\n“ — a century,” said harry, shoveling pie into his \\nmouth. he felt particularly hungry after the \\nexcitement of the afternoon. “wood told me.” \\n\\nron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and \\ngaped at harry. \\n\\n“i start training next week,” said harry. “only don’t \\ntell anyone, wood wants to keep it a secret.” \\n\\nfred and george weasley now came into the hall, \\nspotted harry, and hurried over. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 170 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“well done,” said george in a low voice. “wood told us. \\nwe’re on the team too — beaters.” \\n\\n“i tell you, we’re going to win that quidditch cup for \\nsure this year,” said fred. “we haven’t won since \\ncharlie left, but this year’s team is going to be \\nbrilliant. you must be good, harry, wood was almost \\nskipping when he told us.” \\n\\n“anyway, we’ve got to go, lee jordan reckons he’s \\nfound a new secret passageway out of the school.” \\n\\n“bet it’s that one behind the statue of gregory the \\nsmarmy that we found in our first week. see you.” \\n\\nfred and george had hardly disappeared when \\nsomeone far less welcome turned up: malfoy, flanked \\nby crabbe and goyle. \\n\\n“having a last meal, potter? when are you getting the \\ntrain back to the muggles?” \\n\\n“you’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the \\nground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” \\nsaid harry coolly. there was of course nothing at all \\nlittle about crabbe and goyle, but as the high table \\nwas full of teachers, neither of them could do more \\nthan crack their knuckles and scowl. \\n\\n“i’d take you on anytime on my own,” said malfoy. \\n“tonight, if you want. wizard’s duel. wands only — \\nno contact. what’s the matter? never heard of a \\nwizard’s duel before, i suppose?” \\n\\n“of course he has,” said ron, wheeling around. “i’m \\nhis second, who’s yours?” \\n\\nmalfoy looked at crabbe and goyle, sizing them up. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 171 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“crabbe,” he said. “midnight all right? well meet you \\nin the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” \\n\\nwhen malfoy had gone, ron and harry looked at each \\nother. \\n\\n“what is a wizard’s duel?” said harry. “and what do \\nyou mean, you’re my second?” \\n\\n“well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said \\nron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. \\ncatching the look on harry’s face, he added quickly, \\n“but people only die in proper duels, you know, with \\nreal wizards. the most you and malfoy’ll be able to do \\nis send sparks at each other. neither of you knows \\nenough magic to do any real damage. i bet he \\nexpected you to refuse, anyway.” \\n\\n“and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens?” \\n\\n“throw it away and punch him on the nose,” ron \\nsuggested. \\n\\n“excuse me.” \\n\\nthey both looked up. it was hermione granger. \\n\\n“can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said ron. \\n\\nhermione ignored him and spoke to harry. \\n\\n“i couldn’t help overhearing what you and malfoy \\nwere saying — ” \\n\\n“bet you could,” ron muttered. \\n\\n“ — and you mustn’t go wandering around the school \\nat night, think of the points you’ll lose gryffindor if \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 172 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyou’re caught, and you’re bound to be. it’s really very \\nselfish of you.” \\n\\n“and it’s really none of your business,” said harry. \\n“good-bye,” said ron. \\n\\nall the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end \\nto the day, harry thought, as he lay awake much later \\nlistening to dean and seamus falling asleep (neville \\nwasn’t back from the hospital wing). ron had spent \\nall evening giving him advice such as “if he tries to \\ncurse you, you’d better dodge it, because i can’t \\nremember how to block them.” there was a very good \\nchance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs. \\nnorris, and harry felt he was pushing his luck, \\nbreaking another school rule today. on the other \\nhand, malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of \\nthe darkness — this was his big chance to beat \\nmalfoy face-to-face. he couldn’t miss it. \\n\\n“half-past eleven,” ron muttered at last, “we’d better \\ngo.” \\n\\nthey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their \\nwands, and crept across the tower room, down the \\nspiral staircase, and into the gryffindor common \\nroom. a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, \\nturning all the armchairs into hunched black \\nshadows. they had almost reached the portrait hole \\nwhen a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “i \\ncan’t believe you’re going to do this, harry.” \\n\\na lamp flickered on. it was hermione granger, \\nwearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \\n\\n“you!” said ron furiously. “go back to bed!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 173 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i almost told your brother,” hermione snapped, \\n\\n“percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” \\n\\nharry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. \\n\\n“come on,” he said to ron. he pushed open the \\nportrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole. \\n\\nhermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. she \\nfollowed ron through the portrait hole, hissing at \\nthem like an angry goose. \\n\\n“don’t you care about gryffindor, do you only care \\nabout yourselves, / don’t want slytherin to win the \\nhouse cup, and you’ll lose all the points i got from \\nprofessor mcgonagall for knowing about switching \\nspells.” \\n\\n“go away.” \\n\\n“all right, but i warned you, you just remember what \\ni said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, \\nyou’re so — ” \\n\\nbut what they were, they didn’t find out. hermione \\nhad turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back \\ninside and found herself facing an empty painting. \\n\\nthe fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and \\nhermione was locked out of gryffindor tower. \\n\\n“now what am i going to do?” she asked shrilly. \\n\\n“that’s your problem,” said ron. “we’ve got to go, \\nwe’re going to be late.” \\n\\nthey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor \\nwhen hermione caught up with them. \\n\\n“i’m coming with you,” she said. \\n\\npage | 174 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you are not.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“d’you think i’m going to stand out here and wait for \\nfilch to catch me? if he finds all three of us i’ll tell \\nhim the truth, that i was trying to stop you, and you \\ncan back me up.” \\n\\n“you’ve got some nerve — ” said ron loudly. \\n\\n“shut up, both of you!” said harry sharply. “i heard \\nsomething.” \\n\\nit was a sort of snuffling. \\n\\n“mrs. norris?” breathed ron, squinting through the \\ndark. \\n\\nit wasn’t mrs. norris. it was neville. he was curled up \\non the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake \\nas they crept nearer. \\n\\n“thank goodness you found me! i’ve been out here for \\nhours, i couldn’t remember the new password to get \\nin to bed.” \\n\\n“keep your voice down, neville. the password’s ‘pig \\nsnout’ but it won’t help you now, the fat lady’s gone \\noff somewhere.” \\n\\n“how’s your arm?” said harry. \\n\\n“fine,” said neville, showing them. “madam pomfrey \\nmended it in about a minute.” \\n\\n“good — well, look, neville, we’ve got to be \\nsomewhere, we’ll see you later — ” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 175 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“don’t leave me!” said neville, scrambling to his feet, \\n\\n“i don’t want to stay here alone, the bloody baron’s \\nbeen past twice already.” \\n\\nron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at \\nhermione and neville. \\n\\n“if either of you get us caught, i’ll never rest until i’ve \\nlearned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us \\nabout, and used it on you.” \\n\\nhermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell ron \\nexactly how to use the curse of the bogies, but harry \\nhissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all \\nforward. \\n\\nthey flitted along corridors striped with bars of \\nmoonlight from the high windows. at every turn harry \\nexpected to run into filch or mrs. norris, but they \\nwere lucky. they sped up a staircase to the third floor \\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room. \\n\\nmalfoy and crabbe weren’t there yet. the crystal \\ntrophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught \\nthem. cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver \\nand gold in the darkness. they edged along the walls, \\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the \\nroom. harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in \\nand started at once. the minutes crept by. \\n\\n“he’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” ron whispered. \\n\\nthen a noise in the next room made them jump. \\n\\nharry had only just raised his wand when they heard \\nsomeone speak — and it wasn’t malfoy. \\n\\n“sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a \\ncorner.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 176 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was filch speaking to mrs. norris. horror-struck, \\nharry waved madly at the other three to follow him as \\nquickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the \\ndoor, away from filch’s voice. neville’s robes had \\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard \\nfilch enter the trophy room. \\n\\n“they’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, \\n“probably hiding.” \\n\\n“this way!” harry mouthed to the others and, \\npetrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full \\nof suits of armor. they could hear filch getting \\nnearer. neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak \\nand broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed ron \\naround the waist, and the pair of them toppled right \\ninto a suit of armor. \\n\\nthe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the \\nwhole castle. \\n\\n“run!” harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted \\ndown the gallery, not looking back to see whether \\nfilch was following — they swung around the \\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then \\nanother, harry in the lead, without any idea where \\nthey were or where they were going — they ripped \\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden \\npassageway, hurtled along it and came out near their \\ncharms classroom, which they knew was miles from \\nthe trophy room. \\n\\n“i think we’ve lost him,” harry panted, leaning against \\nthe cold wall and wiping his forehead. neville was \\nbent double, wheezing and spluttering. \\n\\n“i — told — you,” hermione gasped, clutching at the \\nstitch in her chest, “i — told — you.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 177 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“we’ve got to get back to gryffindor tower,” said ron, \\n“quickly as possible.” \\n\\n“malfoy tricked you,” hermione said to harry. “you \\nrealize that, don’t you? he was never going to meet \\nyou — filch knew someone was going to be in the \\ntrophy room, malfoy must have tipped him off.” \\n\\nharry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t \\ngoing to tell her that. \\n\\n“let’s go.” \\n\\nit wasn’t going to be that simple. they hadn’t gone \\nmore than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled \\nand something came shooting out of a classroom in \\nfront of them. \\n\\nit was peeves. he caught sight of them and gave a \\nsqueal of delight. \\n\\n“shut up, peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown \\nout.” \\n\\npeeves cackled. \\n\\n“wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties? tut, \\ntut, tut. naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” \\n\\n“not if you don’t give us away, peeves, please.” \\n\\n“should tell filch, i should,” said peeves in a sanity \\nvoice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “it’s for your \\nown good, you know.” \\n\\n“get out of the way,” snapped ron, taking a swipe at \\npeeves — this was a big mistake. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 178 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“students out of bed!” peeves bellowed, \\n“students out of bed down the charms \\ncorridor!” \\n\\nducking under peeves, they ran for their lives, right \\nto the end of the corridor where they slammed into a \\ndoor — and it was locked. \\n\\n“this is it!” ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at \\nthe door, “we’re done for! this is the end!” \\n\\nthey could hear footsteps, filch running as fast as he \\ncould toward peeves ’s shouts. \\n\\n“oh, move over,” hermione snarled. she grabbed \\nharry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \\n“alohomora\\\\” \\n\\nthe lock clicked and the door swung open — they \\npiled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their \\nears against it, listening. \\n\\n“which way did they go, peeves?” filch was saying. \\n“quick, tell me.” \\n\\n“say ‘please.’ ” \\n\\n“don’t mess with me, peeves, now where did they go?” \\n\\n“shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said \\npeeves in his annoying singsong voice. \\n\\n“all right — please.” \\n\\n“nothing! ha haaa! told you i wouldn’t say nothing \\nif you didn’t say please! ha ha! haaaaaa!” and they \\nheard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch \\ncursing in rage. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 179 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“he thinks this door is locked,” harry whispered. “i \\nthink well be okay — get off neville!” for neville had \\nbeen tugging on the sleeve of harry’s bathrobe for the \\nlast minute. “what?” \\n\\nharry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. \\nfor a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a \\nnightmare — this was too much, on top of everything \\nthat had happened so far. \\n\\nthey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. they \\nwere in a corridor. the forbidden corridor on the third \\nfloor. and now they knew why it was forbidden. \\n\\nthey were looking straight into the eyes of a \\nmonstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space \\nbetween ceiling and floor. it had three heads. three \\npairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and \\nquivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, \\nsaliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \\n\\nit was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, \\nand harry knew that the only reason they weren’t \\nalready dead was that their sudden appearance had \\ntaken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over \\nthat, there was no mistaking what those thunderous \\ngrowls meant. \\n\\nharry groped for the doorknob — between filch and \\ndeath, he’d take filch. \\n\\nthey fell backward — harry slammed the door shut, \\nand they ran, they almost flew, back down the \\ncorridor. filch must have hurried off to look for them \\nsomewhere else, because they didn’t see him \\nanywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to \\ndo was put as much space as possible between them \\nand that monster. they didn’t stop running until they \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 180 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh \\nfloor. \\n\\n“where on earth have you all been?” she asked, \\nlooking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders \\nand their flushed, sweaty faces. \\n\\n“never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted \\nharry, and the portrait swung forward. they \\nscrambled into the common room and collapsed, \\ntrembling, into armchairs. \\n\\nit was a while before any of them said anything. \\nneville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. \\n\\n“what do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing \\nlike that locked up in a school?” said ron finally. “if \\nany dog needs exercise, that one does.” \\n\\nhermione had got both her breath and her bad \\ntemper back again. \\n\\n“you don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she \\nsnapped. “didn’t you see what it was standing on?” \\n\\n“the floor?” harry suggested. “i wasn’t looking at its \\nfeet, i was too busy with its heads.” \\n\\n“no, not the floor. it was standing on a trapdoor. it’s \\nobviously guarding something.” \\n\\nshe stood up, glaring at them. \\n\\n“i hope you’re pleased with yourselves. we could all \\nhave been killed — or worse, expelled. now, if you \\ndon’t mind, i’m going to bed.” \\n\\nron stared after her, his mouth open. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 181 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“no, we don’t mind,” he said. “you’d think we dragged \\nher along, wouldn’t you?” \\n\\nbut hermione had given harry something else to \\nthink about as he climbed back into bed. the dog was \\nguarding something. . . . what had hagrid said? \\ngringotts was the safest place in the world for \\nsomething you wanted to hide — except perhaps \\nhogwarts. \\n\\nit looked as though harry had found out where the \\ngrubby little package from vault seven hundred and \\nthirteen was. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 182 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhalloween \\n\\nmalfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that \\nharry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day, \\nlooking tired but perfectly cheerful. indeed, by the \\nnext morning harry and ron thought that meeting \\nthe three-headed dog had been an excellent \\nadventure, and they were quite keen to have another \\none. in the meantime, harry filled ron in about the \\npackage that seemed to have been moved from \\ngringotts to hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time \\nwondering what could possibly need such heavy \\nprotection. \\n\\n“it’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said \\nron. \\n\\n“or both,” said harry. \\n\\nbut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious \\nobject was that it was about two inches long, they \\ndidn’t have much chance of guessing what it was \\nwithout further clues. \\n\\npage | 183 \\n\\n\\n\\nneither neville nor hermione showed the slightest \\ninterest in what lay underneath the dog and the \\ntrapdoor. all neville cared about was never going near \\nthe dog again. \\n\\nhermione was now refusing to speak to harry and \\nron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they \\nsaw this as an added bonus. all they really wanted \\nnow was a way of getting back at malfoy, and to their \\ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail \\nabout a week later. \\n\\nas the owls flooded into the great hall as usual, \\neveryone’s attention was caught at once by a long, \\nthin package carried by six large screech owls. harry \\nwas just as interested as everyone else to see what \\nwas in this large parcel, and was amazed when the \\nowls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, \\nknocking his bacon to the floor. they had hardly \\nfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a \\nletter on top of the parcel. \\n\\nharry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, \\nbecause it said: \\n\\n\\n\\ndo not open the parcel at the table. \\n\\nit contains your new nimbus two thousand, but i \\ndon’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a \\nbroomstick or they’ll all want one. oliver wood will \\nmeet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven \\no’clock for your first training session. \\n\\nprofessor m. mcgonagall \\n\\nharry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the \\nnote to ron to read. \\n\\npage | 184 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“a nimbus two thousand!” ron moaned enviously. \\n“i’ve never even touched one.” \\n\\nthey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the \\nbroomstick in private before their first class, but \\nhalfway across the entrance hall they found the way \\nupstairs barred by crabbe and goyle. malfoy seized \\nthe package from harry and felt it. \\n\\n“that’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to \\nharry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \\n“you’ll be in for it this time, potter, first years aren’t \\nallowed them.” \\n\\nron couldn’t resist it. \\n\\n“it’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a nimbus \\ntwo thousand. what did you say you’ve got at home, \\nmalfoy, a comet two sixty?” ron grinned at harry. \\n“comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same \\nleague as the nimbus.” \\n\\n“what would you know about it, weasley, you \\ncouldn’t afford half the handle,” malfoy snapped back. \\n“i suppose you and your brothers have to save up \\ntwig by twig.” \\n\\nbefore ron could answer, professor flitwick appeared \\nat malfoy’s elbow. \\n\\n“not arguing, i hope, boys?” he squeaked. \\n\\n“potters been sent a broomstick, professor,” said \\nmalfoy quickly. \\n\\n“yes, yes, that’s right,” said professor flitwick, \\nbeaming at harry. “professor mcgonagall told me all \\nabout the special circumstances, potter. and what \\nmodel is it?” \\n\\npage | 185 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“a nimbus two thousand, sir,” said harry, fighting \\nnot to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy’s face. \\n“and it’s really thanks to malfoy here that i’ve got it,” \\nhe added. \\n\\nharry and ron headed upstairs, smothering their \\nlaughter at malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. \\n\\n“well, it’s true,” harry chortled as they reached the \\ntop of the marble staircase, “if he hadn’t stolen \\nneville’s remembrall i wouldn’t be on the team. ...” \\n\\n“so i suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking \\nrules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. \\nhermione was stomping up the stairs, looking \\ndisapprovingly at the package in harry’s hand. \\n\\n“i thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said harry. \\n\\n“yes, don’t stop now,” said ron, “it’s doing us so \\nmuch good.” \\n\\nhermione marched away with her nose in the air. \\n\\nharry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his \\nlessons that day. it kept wandering up to the \\ndormitory where his new broomstick was lying under \\nhis bed, or straying off to the quidditch field where \\nhe’d be learning to play that night. he bolted his \\ndinner that evening without noticing what he was \\neating, and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap \\nthe nimbus two thousand at last. \\n\\n“wow,” ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto \\nharry’s bedspread. \\n\\neven harry, who knew nothing about the different \\nbrooms, thought it looked wonderful. sleek and \\nshiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of \\n\\npage | 186 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nneat, straight twigs and nimbus two thousand \\nwritten in gold near the top. \\n\\nas seven o’clock drew nearer, harry left the castle and \\nset off in the dusk toward the quidditch field. he’d \\nnever been inside the stadium before. hundreds of \\nseats were raised in stands around the field so that \\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was \\ngoing on. at either end of the field were three golden \\npoles with hoops on the end. they reminded harry of \\nthe little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles \\nthrough, except that they were fifty feet high. \\n\\ntoo eager to fly again to wait for wood, harry \\nmounted his broomstick and kicked off from the \\nground. what a feeling — he swooped in and out of \\nthe goal posts and then sped up and down the field. \\nthe nimbus two thousand turned wherever he \\nwanted at his lightest touch. \\n\\n“hey, potter, come down!” \\n\\noliver wood had arrived. he was carrying a large \\nwooden crate under his arm. harry landed next to \\nhim. \\n\\n“very nice,” said wood, his eyes glinting. “i see what \\nmcgonagall meant ... you really are a natural. i’m \\njust going to teach you the rules this evening, then \\nyou’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” \\n\\nhe opened the crate. inside were four different-sized \\nballs. \\n\\n“right,” said wood. “now, quidditch is easy enough to \\nunderstand, even if it’s not too easy to play. there are \\nseven players on each side. three of them are called \\nchasers.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 187 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“three chasers,” harry repeated, as wood took out a \\nbright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \\n\\n“this ball’s called the quaffle,” said wood. “the \\nchasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and \\nget it through one of the hoops to score a goal. ten \\npoints every time the quaffle goes through one of the \\nhoops. follow me?” \\n\\n“the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through \\nthe hoops to score,” harry recited. “so — that’s sort of \\nlike basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t \\nit?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“what’s basketball?” said wood curiously. \\n\\n“never mind,” said harry quickly. \\n\\n“now, there’s another player on each side who’s called \\nthe keeper — i’m keeper for gryffindor. i have to fly \\naround our hoops and stop the other team from \\nscoring.” \\n\\n“three chasers, one keeper,” said harry, who was \\ndetermined to remember it all. “and they play with \\nthe quaffle. okay, got that. so what are they for?” he \\npointed at the three balls left inside the box. \\n\\n“i’ll show you now,” said wood. “take this.” \\n\\nhe handed harry a small club, a bit like a short \\nbaseball bat. \\n\\n“i’m going to show you what the bludgers do,” wood \\nsaid. “these two are the bludgers.” \\n\\nhe showed harry two identical balls, jet black and \\nslightly smaller than the red quaffle. harry noticed \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 188 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat they seemed to be straining to escape the straps \\nholding them inside the box. \\n\\n“stand back,” wood warned harry. he bent down and \\nfreed one of the bludgers. \\n\\nat once, the black ball rose high in the air and then \\npelted straight at harry’s face. harry swung at it with \\nthe bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it \\nzigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their \\nheads and then shot at wood, who dived on top of it \\nand managed to pin it to the ground. \\n\\n“see?” wood panted, forcing the struggling bludger \\nback into the crate and strapping it down safely. “the \\nbludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off \\ntheir brooms. that’s why you have two beaters on \\neach team — the weasley twins are ours — it’s their \\njob to protect their side from the bludgers and try and \\nknock them toward the other team. so — think you’ve \\ngot all that?” \\n\\n“three chasers try and score with the quaffle; the \\nkeeper guards the goal posts; the beaters keep the \\nbludgers away from their team,” harry reeled off. \\n\\n“very good,” said wood. \\n\\n“er — have the bludgers ever killed anyone?” harry \\nasked, hoping he sounded offhand. \\n\\n“never at hogwarts. we’ve had a couple of broken \\njaws but nothing worse than that. now, the last \\nmember of the team is the seeker. that’s you. and \\nyou don’t have to worry about the quaffle or the \\nbludgers — ” \\n\\n“ — unless they crack my head open.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 189 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“don’t worry, the weasleys are more than a match for \\nthe bludgers — i mean, they’re like a pair of human \\nbludgers themselves.” \\n\\nwood reached into the crate and took out the fourth \\nand last ball. compared with the quaffle and the \\nbludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. \\nit was bright gold and had little fluttering silver \\nwings. \\n\\n“this,” said wood, “is the golden snitch, and it’s the \\nmost important ball of the lot. it’s very hard to catch \\nbecause it’s so fast and difficult to see. it’s the \\nseeker’s job to catch it. you’ve got to weave in and out \\nof the chasers, beaters, bludgers, and quaffle to get \\nit before the other team’s seeker, because whichever \\nseeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra \\nhundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. \\nthat’s why seekers get fouled so much. a game of \\nquidditch only ends when the snitch is caught, so it \\ncan go on for ages — i think the record is three \\nmonths, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so \\nthe players could get some sleep. \\n\\n“well, that’s it — any questions?” \\n\\nharry shook his head. he understood what he had to \\ndo all right, it was doing it that was going to be the \\nproblem. \\n\\n“we won’t practice with the snitch yet,” said wood, \\ncarefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too \\ndark, we might lose it. let’s try you out with a few of \\nthese.” \\n\\nhe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket \\nand a few minutes later, he and harry were up in the \\nair, wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could \\nin every direction for harry to catch. \\n\\npage | 190 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry didn’t miss a single one, and wood was \\ndelighted. after half an hour, night had really fallen \\nand they couldn’t carry on. \\n\\n“that quidditch cup’ll have our name on it this year,” \\nsaid wood happily as they trudged back up to the \\ncastle. “i wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better \\nthan charlie weasley, and he could have played for \\nengland if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” \\n\\nperhaps it was because he was now so busy, what \\nwith quidditch practice three evenings a week on top \\nof all his homework, but harry could hardly believe it \\nwhen he realized that he’d already been at hogwarts \\ntwo months. the castle felt more like home than \\nprivet drive ever had. his lessons, too, were becoming \\nmore and more interesting now that they had \\nmastered the basics. \\n\\non halloween morning they woke to the delicious \\nsmell of baking pumpkin wafting through the \\ncorridors. even better, professor flitwick announced \\nin charms that he thought they were ready to start \\nmaking objects fly, something they had all been dying \\nto try since they’d seen him make neville’s toad zoom \\naround the classroom. professor flitwick put the \\nclass into pairs to practice. harry’s partner was \\nseamus finnigan (which was a relief, because neville \\nhad been trying to catch his eye). ron, however, was \\nto be working with hermione granger. it was hard to \\ntell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this. \\nshe hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day \\nharry’s broomstick had arrived. \\n\\n“now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve \\nbeen practicing!” squeaked professor flitwick, \\nperched on top of his pile of books as usual. “swish \\nand flick, remember, swish and flick. and saying the \\nmagic words properly is very important, too — never \\npage | 191 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nforget wizard baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f and \\nfound himself on the floor with a buffalo on his \\nchest.” \\n\\nit was very difficult. harry and seamus swished and \\nflicked, but the feather they were supposed to be \\nsending skyward just lay on the desktop. seamus got \\nso impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set \\nfire to it — harry had to put it out with his hat. \\n\\nron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more \\nluck. \\n\\n“wingardium leviosal” he shouted, waving his long \\narms like a windmill. \\n\\n“you’re saying it wrong,” harry heard hermione snap. \\n“it’s wing-gar-dium levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and \\nlong.” \\n\\n“you do it, then, if you’re so clever,” ron snarled. \\n\\nhermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked \\nher wand, and said, “wingardium leviosav’ \\n\\ntheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four \\nfeet above their heads. \\n\\n“oh, well done!” cried professor flitwick, clapping. \\n“everyone see here, miss granger’s done it!” \\n\\nron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \\n\\n“it’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to \\nharry as they pushed their way into the crowded \\ncorridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 192 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsomeone knocked into harry as they hurried past \\nhim. it was hermione. harry caught a glimpse of her \\nface — and was startled to see that she was in tears. \\n\\n“i think she heard you.” \\n\\n“so?” said ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \\n“she must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” \\n\\nhermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t \\nseen all afternoon. on their way down to the great \\nhall for the halloween feast, harry and ron overheard \\nparvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione \\nwas crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be \\nleft alone. ron looked still more awkward at this, but \\na moment later they had entered the great hall, \\nwhere the halloween decorations put hermione out of \\ntheir minds. \\n\\na thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and \\nceiling while a thousand more swooped over the \\ntables in low black clouds, making the candles in the \\npumpkins stutter. the feast appeared suddenly on \\nthe golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term \\nbanquet. \\n\\nharry was just helping himself to a baked potato \\nwhen professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall, \\nhis turban askew and terror on his face. everyone \\nstared as he reached professor dumbledore’s chair, \\nslumped against the table, and gasped, “troll — in \\nthe dungeons — thought you ought to know.” \\n\\nhe then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \\n\\nthere was an uproar. it took several purple \\nfirecrackers exploding from the end of professor \\ndumbledore’s wand to bring silence. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 193 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your houses back to the \\ndormitories immediately!” \\n\\npercy was in his element. \\n\\n“follow me! stick together, first years! no need to fear \\nthe troll if you follow my orders! stay close behind \\nme, now. make way, first years coming through! \\nexcuse me, i’m a prefect!” \\n\\n“how could a troll get in?” harry asked as they \\nclimbed the stairs. \\n\\n“don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” \\nsaid ron. “maybe peeves let it in for a halloween \\njoke.” \\n\\nthey passed different groups of people hurrying in \\ndifferent directions. as they jostled their way through \\na crowd of confused hufflepuffs, harry suddenly \\ngrabbed ron’s arm. \\n\\n“i’ve just thought — hermione.” \\n\\n“what about her?” \\n\\n“she doesn’t know about the troll.” \\n\\nron bit his lip. \\n\\n“oh, all right,” he snapped. “but percy’d better not \\nsee us.” \\n\\nducking down, they joined the hufflepuffs going the \\nother way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and \\nhurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. they had just \\nturned the corner when they heard quick footsteps \\nbehind them. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 194 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“percy!” hissed ron, pulling harry behind a large \\nstone griffin. \\n\\npeering around it, however, they saw not percy but \\nsnape. he crossed the corridor and disappeared from \\nview. \\n\\n“what’s he doing?” harry whispered. “why isn’t he \\ndown in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” \\n\\n“search me.” \\n\\nquietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor \\nafter snape ’s fading footsteps. \\n\\n“he’s heading for the third floor,” harry said, but ron \\nheld up his hand. \\n\\n“can you smell something?” \\n\\nharry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a \\nmixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no \\none seems to clean. \\n\\nand then they heard it — a low grunting, and the \\nshuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. ron pointed — at \\nthe end of a passage to the left, something huge was \\nmoving toward them. they shrank into the shadows \\nand watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \\n\\nit was a horrible sight. twelve feet tall, its skin was a \\ndull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder \\nwith its small bald head perched on top like a \\ncoconut. it had short legs thick as tree trunks with \\nflat, horny feet. the smell coming from it was \\nincredible. it was holding a huge wooden club, which \\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 195 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. \\nit waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then \\nslouched slowly into the room. \\n\\n“the key’s in the lock,” harry muttered. “we could \\nlock it in.” \\n\\n“good idea,” said ron nervously. \\n\\nthey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, \\npraying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. with \\none great leap, harry managed to grab the key, slam \\nthe door, and lock it. \\n\\n“yes!” \\n\\nflushed with their victory, they started to run back \\nup the passage, but as they reached the corner they \\nheard something that made their hearts stop — a \\nhigh, petrified scream — and it was coming from the \\nchamber they’d just chained up. \\n\\n“oh, no,” said ron, pale as the bloody baron. \\n\\n“it’s the girls’ bathroom!” harry gasped. \\n\\n“ hermionel” they said together. \\n\\nit was the last thing they wanted to do, but what \\nchoice did they have? wheeling around, they sprinted \\nback to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their \\npanic. harry pulled the door open and they ran \\ninside. \\n\\nhermione granger was shrinking against the wall \\nopposite, looking as if she was about to faint. the troll \\nwas advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the \\nwalls as it went. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 196 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“confuse it!” harry said desperately to ron, and, \\nseizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against \\nthe wall. \\n\\nthe troll stopped a few feet from hermione. it \\nlumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had \\nmade the noise. its mean little eyes saw harry. it \\nhesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club \\nas it went. \\n\\n“oy, pea-brain!” yelled ron from the other side of the \\nchamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. the troll \\ndidn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its \\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, \\nturning its ugly snout toward ron instead, giving \\nharry time to run around it. \\n\\n“come on, run, run\\\\” harry yelled at hermione, trying \\nto pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, \\nshe was still flat against the wall, her mouth open \\nwith terror. \\n\\nthe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the \\ntroll berserk. it roared again and started toward ron, \\nwho was nearest and had no way to escape. \\n\\nharry then did something that was both very brave \\nand very stupid: he took a great running jump and \\nmanaged to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck \\nfrom behind. the troll couldn’t feel harry hanging \\nthere, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit \\nof wood up its nose, and harry’s wand had still been \\nin his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight \\nup one of the troll’s nostrils. \\n\\nhowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its \\nclub, with harry clinging on for dear life; any second, \\nthe troll was going to rip him off or catch him a \\nterrible blow with the club. \\n\\npage | 197 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhermione had sunk to the floor in fright; ron pulled \\nout his own wand — not knowing what he was going \\nto do he heard himself cry the first spell that came \\ninto his head: “wingardium leviosal” \\n\\nthe club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose \\nhigh, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and \\ndropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s \\nhead. the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat \\non its face, with a thud that made the whole room \\ntremble. \\n\\nharry got to his feet. he was shaking and out of \\nbreath. ron was standing there with his wand still \\nraised, staring at what he had done. \\n\\nit was hermione who spoke first. \\n\\n“is it — dead?” \\n\\n“i don’t think so,” said harry, “i think it’s just been \\nknocked out.” \\n\\nhe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s \\nnose. it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray \\nglue. \\n\\n“urgh — troll boogers.” \\n\\nhe wiped it on the troll’s trousers. \\n\\na sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the \\nthree of them look up. they hadn’t realized what a \\nracket they had been making, but of course, someone \\ndownstairs must have heard the crashes and the \\ntroll’s roars. a moment later, professor mcgonagall \\nhad come bursting into the room, closely followed by \\nsnape, with quirrell bringing up the rear. quirrell \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 198 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntook one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and \\nsat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \\n\\nsnape bent over the troll. professor mcgonagall was \\nlooking at ron and harry. harry had never seen her \\nlook so angry. her lips were white. hopes of winning \\nfifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harry’s \\nmind. \\n\\n“what on earth were you thinking of?” said professor \\nmcgonagall, with cold fury in her voice. harry looked \\nat ron, who was still standing with his wand in the \\nair. “you’re lucky you weren’t killed. why aren’t you \\nin your dormitory?” \\n\\nsnape gave harry a swift, piercing look. harry looked \\nat the floor. he wished ron would put his wand down. \\n\\nthen a small voice came out of the shadows. \\n\\n“please, professor mcgonagall — they were looking for \\nme.” \\n\\n“miss granger!” \\n\\nhermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \\n\\n“i went looking for the troll because i — i thought i \\ncould deal with it on my own — you know, because \\ni’ve read all about them.” \\n\\nron dropped his wand. hermione granger, telling a \\ndownright lie to a teacher? \\n\\n“if they hadn’t found me, i’d be dead now. harry \\nstuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out \\nwith its own club. they didn’t have time to come and \\nfetch anyone. it was about to finish me off when they \\narrived.” \\n\\npage | 199 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry and ron tried to look as though this story \\nwasn’t new to them. \\n\\n“well — in that case ...” said professor mcgonagall, \\nstaring at the three of them, “miss granger, you \\nfoolish girl, how could you think of tackling a \\nmountain troll on your own?” \\n\\nhermione hung her head. harry was speechless. \\nhermione was the last person to do anything against \\nthe rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to \\nget them out of trouble. it was as if snape had started \\nhanding out sweets. \\n\\n“miss granger, five points will be taken from \\ngryffindor for this,” said professor mcgonagall. “i’m \\nvery disappointed in you. if you’re not hurt at all, \\nyou’d better get off to gryffindor tower. students are \\nfinishing the feast in their houses.” \\n\\nhermione left. \\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron. \\n\\n“well, i still say you were lucky, but not many first \\nyears could have taken on a full-grown mountain \\ntroll. you each win gryffindor five points. professor \\ndumbledore will be informed of this. you may go.” \\n\\nthey hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at \\nall until they had climbed two floors up. it was a relief \\nto be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from \\nanything else. \\n\\n“we should have gotten more than ten points,” ron \\ngrumbled. \\n\\n“five, you mean, once she’s taken off hermione ’s.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 200 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” ron \\nadmitted. “mind you, we did save her.” \\n\\n“she might not have needed saving if we hadn’t \\nlocked the thing in with her,” harry reminded him. \\n\\nthey had reached the portrait of the fat lady. \\n\\n“pig snout,” they said and entered. \\n\\nthe common room was packed and noisy. everyone \\nwas eating the food that had been sent up. hermione, \\nhowever, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. \\nthere was a very embarrassed pause. then, none of \\nthem looking at each other, they all said “thanks,” \\nand hurried off to get plates. \\n\\nbut from that moment on, hermione granger became \\ntheir friend. there are some things you can’t share \\nwithout ending up liking each other, and knocking \\nout a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 201 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquidditch \\n\\nas they entered november, the weather turned very \\ncold. the mountains around the school became icy \\ngray and the lake like chilled steel. every morning the \\nground was covered in frost. hagrid could be seen \\nfrom the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on \\nthe quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin \\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin \\nboots. \\n\\nthe quidditch season had begun. on saturday, harry \\nwould be playing in his first match after weeks of \\ntraining: gryffindor versus slytherin. if gryffindor \\nwon, they would move up into second place in the \\nhouse championship. \\n\\nhardly anyone had seen harry play because wood \\nhad decided that, as their secret weapon, harry \\nshould be kept, well, secret. but the news that he was \\nplaying seeker had leaked out somehow, and harry \\ndidn’t know which was worse — people telling him \\nhe’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be \\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress. \\npage | 202 \\n\\n\\n\\nit was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a \\nfriend. he didn’t know how he’d have gotten through \\nall his homework without her, what with all the last- \\nminute quidditch practice wood was making them \\ndo. she had also lent him quidditch through the ages, \\nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read. \\n\\nharry learned that there were seven hundred ways of \\ncommitting a quidditch foul and that all of them had \\nhappened during a world cup match in 1473; that \\nseekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, \\nand that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to \\nhappen to them; that although people rarely died \\nplaying quidditch, referees had been known to vanish \\nand turn up months later in the sahara desert. \\n\\nhermione had become a bit more relaxed about \\nbreaking rules since harry and ron had saved her \\nfrom the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for \\nit. the day before harry’s first quidditch match the \\nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard \\nduring break, and she had conjured them up a bright \\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. \\nthey were standing with their backs to it, getting \\nwarm, when snape crossed the yard. harry noticed at \\nonce that snape was limping. harry, ron, and \\nhermione moved closer together to block the fire from \\nview; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. \\nunfortunately, something about their guilty faces \\ncaught snape’s eye. he limped over. he hadn’t seen \\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to \\ntell them off anyway. \\n\\n“what’s that you’ve got there, potter?” \\n\\nit was quidditch through the ages. harry showed him. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 203 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“library books are not to be taken outside the \\nschool,” said snape. “give it to me. five points from \\ngryffindor.” \\n\\n“he’s just made that rule up,” harry muttered angrily \\nas snape limped away. “wonder what’s wrong with \\nhis leg?” \\n\\n“dunno, but i hope it’s really hurting him,” said ron \\nbitterly. \\n\\nthe gryffindor common room was very noisy that \\nevening. harry, ron, and hermione sat together next \\nto a window. hermione was checking harry and ron’s \\ncharms homework for them. she would never let \\nthem copy (“how will you learn?”), but by asking her \\nto read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \\n\\nharry felt restless. he wanted quidditch through the \\nages back, to take his mind off his nerves about \\ntomorrow. why should he be afraid of snape? getting \\nup, he told ron and hermione he was going to ask \\nsnape if he could have it. \\n\\n“better you than me,” they said together, but harry \\nhad an idea that snape wouldn’t refuse if there were \\nother teachers listening. \\n\\nhe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. \\nthere was no answer. he knocked again. nothing. \\n\\nperhaps snape had left the book in there? it was \\nworth a try. he pushed the door ajar and peered \\ninside — and a horrible scene met his eyes. \\n\\nsnape and filch were inside, alone. snape was \\nholding his robes above his knees. one of his legs was \\nbloody and mangled. filch was handing snape \\nbandages. \\n\\npage | 204 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“blasted thing,” snape was saying. “how are you \\nsupposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at \\nonce?” \\n\\nharry tried to shut the door quietly, but — \\n\\n“potter!” \\n\\nsnape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his \\nrobes quickly to hide his leg. harry gulped. \\n\\n“i just wondered if i could have my book back.” \\n\\n“get out! out!” \\n\\nharry left, before snape could take any more points \\nfrom gryffindor. he sprinted back upstairs. \\n\\n“did you get it?” ron asked as harry joined them. \\n“what’s the matter?” \\n\\nin a low whisper, harry told them what he’d seen. \\n\\n“you know what this means?” he finished \\nbreathlessly. “he tried to get past that three-headed \\ndog at halloween! that’s where he was going when we \\nsaw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! and i’d \\nbet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a \\ndiversion!” \\n\\nhermione’s eyes were wide. \\n\\n“no — he wouldn’t,” she said. “i know he’s not very \\nnice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something \\ndumbledore was keeping safe.” \\n\\n“honestly, hermione, you think all teachers are saints \\nor something,” snapped ron. “i’m with harry. i \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 205 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwouldn’t put anything past snape. but what’s he \\nafter? what’s that dog guarding?” \\n\\nharry went to bed with his head buzzing with the \\nsame question. neville was snoring loudly, but harry \\ncouldn’t sleep. he tried to empty his mind — he \\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first quidditch \\nmatch in a few hours — but the expression on \\nsnape’s face when harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy \\nto forget. \\n\\nthe next morning dawned very bright and cold. the \\ngreat hall was full of the delicious smell of fried \\nsausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking \\nforward to a good quidditch match. \\n\\n“you’ve got to eat some breakfast.” \\n\\n“i don’t want anything.” \\n\\n“just a bit of toast,” wheedled hermione. \\n\\n“i’m not hungry.” \\n\\nharry felt terrible. in an hour’s time he’d be walking \\nonto the field. \\n\\n“harry, you need your strength,” said seamus \\nfinnigan. “seekers are always the ones who get \\nclobbered by the other team.” \\n\\n“thanks, seamus,” said harry, watching seamus pile \\nketchup on his sausages. \\n\\nby eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out \\nin the stands around the quidditch pitch. many \\nstudents had binoculars. the seats might be raised \\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what \\nwas going on sometimes. \\n\\npage | 206 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nron and hermione joined neville, seamus, and dean \\nthe west ham fan up in the top row. as a surprise for \\nharry, they had painted a large banner on one of the \\nsheets scabbers had ruined. it said potter for \\npresident, and dean, who was good at drawing, had \\ndone a large gryffindor lion underneath. then \\nhermione had performed a tricky little charm so that \\nthe paint flashed different colors. \\n\\nmeanwhile, in the locker room, harry and the rest of \\nthe team were changing into their scarlet quidditch \\nrobes (slytherin would be playing in green) . \\n\\nwood cleared his throat for silence. \\n\\n“okay, men,” he said. \\n\\n“and women,” said chaser angelina johnson. \\n\\n“and women,” wood agreed. “this is it.” \\n\\n“the big one,” said fred weasley. \\n\\n“the one we’ve all been waiting for,” said george. \\n\\n“we know oliver’s speech by heart,” fred told harry, \\n“we were on the team last year.” \\n\\n“shut up, you two,” said wood. “this is the best team \\ngryffindor’s had in years. we’re going to win. i know \\nit.” \\n\\nhe glared at them all as if to say, “or else.” \\n\\n“right. it’s time. good luck, all of you.” \\n\\nharry followed fred and george out of the locker \\nroom and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, \\nwalked onto the field to loud cheers. \\n\\npage | 207 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmadam hooch was refereeing. she stood in the \\nmiddle of the field waiting for the two teams, her \\nbroom in her hand. \\n\\n“now, i want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, \\nonce they were all gathered around her. harry noticed \\nthat she seemed to be speaking particularly to the \\nslytherin captain, marcus flint, a fifth year. harry \\nthought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in \\nhim. out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering \\nbanner high above, flashing potter for president over \\nthe crowd. his heart skipped. he felt braver. \\n\\n“mount your brooms, please.” \\n\\nharry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand. \\n\\nmadam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \\n\\nfifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. they \\nwere off. \\n\\n“and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina \\njohnson of gryffindor — what an excellent chaser \\nthat girl is, and rather attractive, too — ” \\n\\n“jordan!” \\n\\n“sorry, professor.” \\n\\nthe weasley twins’ friend, lee jordan, was doing the \\ncommentary for the match, closely watched by \\nprofessor mcgonagall. \\n\\n“and she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass \\nto alicia spinnet, a good find of oliver wood’s, last \\nyear only a reserve — back to johnson and — no, the \\nslytherins have taken the quaffle, slytherin captain \\nmarcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes — flint \\npage | 208 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nflying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no, \\nstopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper \\nwood and the gryffindors take the quaffle — that’s \\nchaser katie bell of gryffindor there, nice dive \\naround flint, off up the field and — ouch — that \\nmust have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a \\nbludger — quaffle taken by the slytherins — that’s \\nadrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but \\nhe’s blocked by a second bludger — sent his way by \\nfred or george weasley, can’t tell which — nice play \\nby the gryffindor beater, anyway, and johnson back \\nin possession of the quaffle, a clear field ahead and \\noff she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding \\nbludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, \\nangelina — keeper bletchley dives — misses — \\ngryffindors score!” \\n\\ngryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and \\nmoans from the slytherins. \\n\\n“budge up there, move along.” \\n\\n“hagrid!” \\n\\nron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid \\nenough space to join them. \\n\\n“bin watchin’ from me hut,” said hagrid, patting a \\nlarge pair of binoculars around his neck, “but it isn’t \\nthe same as bein’ in the crowd. no sign of the snitch \\nyet, eh?” \\n\\n“nope,” said ron. “harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” \\n\\n“kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said \\nhagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at \\nthe speck that was harry. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 209 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nway up above them, harry was gliding over the game, \\nsquinting about for some sign of the snitch. this was \\npart of his and wood’s game plan. \\n\\n“keep out of the way until you catch sight of the \\nsnitch,” wood had said. “we don’t want you attacked \\nbefore you have to be.” \\n\\nwhen angelina had scored, harry had done a couple \\nof loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. now he was \\nback to staring around for the snitch. once he caught \\nsight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection \\nfrom one of the weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a \\nbludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a \\ncannonball than anything, but harry dodged it and \\nfred weasley came chasing after it. \\n\\n“all right there, harry?” he had time to yell, as he \\nbeat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint. \\n\\n“slytherin in possession,” lee jordan was saying, \\n“chaser pucey ducks two bludgers, two weasleys, \\nand chaser bell, and speeds toward the — wait a \\nmoment — was that the snitch?” \\n\\na murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey \\ndropped the quaffle, too busy looking over his \\nshoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left \\near. \\n\\nharry saw it. in a great rush of excitement he dived \\ndownward after the streak of gold. slytherin seeker \\nterence higgs had seen it, too. neck and neck they \\nhurtled toward the snitch — all the chasers seemed \\nto have forgotten what they were supposed to be \\ndoing as they hung in midair to watch. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 210 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry was faster than higgs — he could see the little \\nround ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he \\nput on an extra spurt of speed — \\n\\nwham! a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors \\nbelow — marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose, \\nand harry’s broom spun off course, harry holding on \\nfor dear life. \\n\\n“foul!” screamed the gryffindors. \\n\\nmadam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered \\na free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor. but in all \\nthe confusion, of course, the golden snitch had \\ndisappeared from sight again. \\n\\ndown in the stands, dean thomas was yelling, “send \\nhim off, ref! red card!” \\n\\n“what are you talking about, dean?” said ron. \\n\\n“red card!” said dean furiously. “in soccer you get \\nshown the red card and you’re out of the game!” \\n\\n“but this isn’t soccer, dean,” ron reminded him. \\n\\nhagrid, however, was on dean’s side. \\n\\n“they oughta change the rules. flint coulda knocked \\nharry outta the air.” \\n\\nlee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \\n\\n“so — after that obvious and disgusting bit of \\ncheating — ” \\n\\n“jordan!” growled professor mcgonagall. \\n\\n“i mean, after that open and revolting foul — ” \\n\\npage | 211 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“jordan, i’m warning you — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“all right, all right. flint nearly kills the gryffindor \\nseeker, which could happen to anyone, i’m sure, so a \\npenalty to gryffindor, taken by spinnet, who puts it \\naway, no trouble, and we continue play, gryffindor \\nstill in possession.” \\n\\nit was as harry dodged another bludger, which went \\nspinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. \\nhis broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. for a \\nsplit second, he thought he was going to fall. he \\ngripped the broom tightly with both his hands and \\nknees. he’d never felt anything like that. \\n\\nit happened again. it was as though the broom was \\ntrying to buck him off. but nimbus two thousands \\ndid not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. harry \\ntried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts — \\nhe had half a mind to ask wood to call time-out — \\nand then he realized that his broom was completely \\nout of his control. he couldn’t turn it. he couldn’t \\ndirect it at all. it was zigzagging through the air, and \\nevery now and then making violent swishing \\nmovements that almost unseated him. \\n\\nlee was still commentating. \\n\\n“slytherin in possession — flint with the quaffle — \\npasses spinnet — passes bell — hit hard in the face \\nby a bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, \\nprofessor — slytherins score — oh no ...” \\n\\nthe slytherins were cheering. no one seemed to have \\nnoticed that harry’s broom was behaving strangely it \\nwas carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, \\njerking and twitching as it went. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 212 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“dunno what harry thinks he’s doing,” hagrid \\nmumbled. he stared through his binoculars. “if i \\ndidn’ know better, i’d say he’d lost control of his \\nbroom ... but he can’t have. ...” \\n\\nsuddenly, people were pointing up at harry all over \\nthe stands. his broom had started to roll over and \\nover, with him only just managing to hold on. then \\nthe whole crowd gasped. harry’s broom had given a \\nwild jerk and harry swung off it. he was now dangling \\nfrom it, holding on with only one hand. \\n\\n“did something happen to it when flint blocked him?” \\nseamus whispered. \\n\\n“can’t have,” hagrid said, his voice shaking. “can’t \\nnothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful \\ndark magic — no kid could do that to a nimbus two \\nthousand.” \\n\\nat these words, hermione seized hagrid ’s binoculars, \\nbut instead of looking up at harry, she started \\nlooking frantically at the crowd. \\n\\n“what are you doing?” moaned ron, gray-faced. \\n\\n“i knew it,” hermione gasped, “snape — look.” \\n\\nron grabbed the binoculars. snape was in the middle \\nof the stands opposite them. he had his eyes fixed on \\nharry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \\n\\n“he’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said \\nhermione. \\n\\n“what should we do?” \\n\\n“leave it to me.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 213 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore ron could say another word, hermione had \\ndisappeared. ron turned the binoculars back on \\nharry. his broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost \\nimpossible for him to hang on much longer. the \\nwhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the \\nweasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one \\nof their brooms, but it was no good — every time they \\ngot near him, the broom would jump higher still. they \\ndropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously \\nhoping to catch him if he fell. marcus flint seized the \\nquaffle and scored five times without anyone \\nnoticing. \\n\\n“come on, hermione,” ron muttered desperately. \\n\\nhermione had fought her way across to the stand \\nwhere snape stood, and was now racing along the row \\nbehind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she \\nknocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in \\nfront. reaching snape, she crouched down, pulled \\nout her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen \\nwords. bright blue flames shot from her wand onto \\nthe hem of snape ’s robes. \\n\\nit took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize \\nthat he was on fire. a sudden yelp told her she had \\ndone her job. scooping the fire off him into a little jar \\nin her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — \\nsnape would never know what had happened. \\n\\nit was enough. up in the air, harry was suddenly able \\nto clamber back on to his broom. \\n\\n“neville, you can look!” ron said. neville had been \\nsobbing into hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. \\n\\nharry was speeding toward the ground when the \\ncrowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 214 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours \\n— coughed — and something gold fell into his hand. \\n\\n“i’ve got the snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his \\nhead, and the game ended in complete confusion. \\n\\n“he didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” flint was \\nstill howling twenty minutes later, but it made no \\ndifference — harry hadn’t broken any rules and lee \\njordan was still happily shouting the results — \\ngryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy \\npoints to sixty. harry heard none of this, though. he \\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid’s \\nhut, with ron and hermione. \\n\\n“it was snape,” ron was explaining, “hermione and i \\nsaw him. he was cursing your broomstick, muttering, \\nhe wouldn’t take his eyes off you.” \\n\\n“rubbish,” said hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of \\nwhat had gone on next to him in the stands. “why \\nwould snape do somethin’ like that?” \\n\\nharry, ron, and hermione looked at one another, \\nwondering what to tell him. harry decided on the \\ntruth. \\n\\n“i found out something about him,” he told hagrid. \\n“he tried to get past that three-headed dog on \\nhalloween. it bit him. we think he was trying to steal \\nwhatever it’s guarding.” \\n\\nhagrid dropped the teapot. \\n\\n“how do you know about fluffy?” he said. \\n\\n“ fluffy ?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 215 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a greek chappie \\ni met in the pub las’ year — i lent him to dumbledore \\nto guard the — ” \\n\\n“yes?” said harry eagerly. \\n\\n“now, don’t ask me anymore,” said hagrid gruffly. \\n“that’s top secret, that is.” \\n\\n“but snape’s trying to steal it.” \\n\\n“rubbish,” said hagrid again. “snape’s a hogwarts \\nteacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.” \\n\\n“so why did he just try and kill harry?” cried \\nhermione. \\n\\nthe afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have \\nchanged her mind about snape. \\n\\n“i know a jinx when i see one, hagrid, i’ve read all \\nabout them! you’ve got to keep eye contact, and \\nsnape wasn’t blinking at all, i saw him!” \\n\\n“i’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said hagrid hotly. “i don’ \\nknow why harry’s broom acted like that, but snape \\nwouldn’ try an’ kill a student! now, listen to me, all \\nthree of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ \\nconcern yeh. it’s dangerous. you forget that dog, an’ \\nyou forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between professor \\ndumbledore an’ nicolas flamel — ■” \\n\\n“aha!” said harry, “so there’s someone called nicolas \\nflamel involved, is there?” \\n\\nhagrid looked furious with himself. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 216 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe mirror of erised \\n\\nchristmas was coming. one morning in mid- \\ndecember, hogwarts woke to find itself covered in \\nseveral feet of snow. the lake froze solid and the \\nweasley twins were punished for bewitching several \\nsnowballs so that they followed quirrell around, \\nbouncing off the back of his turban. the few owls that \\nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky \\nto deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by \\nhagrid before they could fly off again. \\n\\nno one could wait for the holidays to start. while the \\ngryffindor common room and the great hall had \\nroaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and \\na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. \\nworst of all were professor snape’s classes down in \\nthe dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist \\nbefore them and they kept as close as possible to \\ntheir hot cauldrons. \\n\\n“i do feel so sorry,” said draco malfoy, one potions \\nclass, “for all those people who have to stay at \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 217 \\n\\n\\n\\nhogwarts for christmas because they’re not wanted \\nat home.” \\n\\nhe was looking over at harry as he spoke. crabbe and \\ngoyle chuckled. harry, who was measuring out \\npowdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. malfoy had \\nbeen even more unpleasant than usual since the \\nquidditch match. disgusted that the slytherins had \\nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a \\nwide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as \\nseeker next. then he’d realized that nobody found \\nthis funny, because they were all so impressed at the \\nway harry had managed to stay on his bucking \\nbroomstick. so malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone \\nback to taunting harry about having no proper \\nfamily. \\n\\nit was true that harry wasn’t going back to privet \\ndrive for christmas. professor mcgonagall had come \\naround the week before, making a list of students \\nwho would be staying for the holidays, and harry had \\nsigned up at once. he didn’t feel sorry for himself at \\nall; this would probably be the best christmas he’d \\never had. ron and his brothers were staying, too, \\nbecause mr. and mrs. weasley were going to romania \\nto visit charlie. \\n\\nwhen they left the dungeons at the end of potions, \\nthey found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. \\ntwo enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a \\nloud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind \\nit. \\n\\n“hi, hagrid, want any help?” ron asked, sticking his \\nhead through the branches. \\n\\n“nah, i’m all right, thanks, ron.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 218 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“would you mind moving out of the way?” came \\nmalfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “are you trying \\nto earn some extra money, weasley? hoping to be \\ngamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts, i \\nsuppose — that hut of hagrid’s must seem like a \\npalace compared to what your family’s used to.” \\n\\nron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs. \\n\\n“weasley!” \\n\\nron let go of the front of malfoy’s robes. \\n\\n“he was provoked, professor snape,” said hagrid, \\nsticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \\n“malfoy was insultin’ his family.” \\n\\n“be that as it may, fighting is against hogwarts rules, \\nhagrid,” said snape silkily. “five points from \\ngryffindor, weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. \\nmove along, all of you.” \\n\\nmalfoy, crabbe, and goyle pushed roughly past the \\ntree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \\n\\n“i’ll get him,” said ron, grinding his teeth at malfoy’s \\nback, “one of these days, i’ll get him — ” \\n\\n“i hate them both,” said harry, “malfoy and snape.” \\n\\n“come on, cheer up, it’s nearly christmas,” said \\nhagrid. “tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the \\ngreat hall, looks a treat.” \\n\\nso the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off \\nto the great hall, where professor mcgonagall and \\nprofessor flitwick were busy with the christmas \\ndecorations. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 219 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ah, hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, \\nwould you?” \\n\\nthe hall looked spectacular. festoons of holly and \\nmistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than \\ntwelve towering christmas trees stood around the \\nroom, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering \\nwith hundreds of candles. \\n\\n“how many days you got left until yer holidays?” \\nhagrid asked. \\n\\n“just one,” said hermione. “and that reminds me — \\nharry, ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we \\nshould be in the library.” \\n\\n“oh yeah, you’re right,” said ron, tearing his eyes \\naway from professor flitwick, who had golden \\nbubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing \\nthem over the branches of the new tree. \\n\\n“the library?” said hagrid, following them out of the \\nhall. “just before the holidays? bit keen, aren’t yeh?” \\n\\n“oh, we’re not working,” harry told him brightly. \\n\\n“ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we’ve been \\ntrying to find out who he is.” \\n\\n“you what?” hagrid looked shocked. “listen here — \\ni’ve told yeh — drop it. it’s nothin’ to you what that \\ndog’s guardin’.” \\n\\n“we just want to know who nicolas flamel is, that’s \\nall,” said hermione. \\n\\n“unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” \\nharry added. “we must’ve been through hundreds of \\nbooks already and we can’t find him anywhere — just \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 220 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngive us a hint — i know i’ve read his name \\nsomewhere.” \\n\\n“i’m sayin’ nothin’,” said hagrid flatly. \\n\\n“just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said ron, \\nand they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried \\noff to the library. \\n\\nthey had indeed been searching books for flamel’s \\nname ever since hagrid had let it slip, because how \\nelse were they going to find out what snape was \\ntrying to steal? the trouble was, it was very hard to \\nknow where to begin, not knowing what flamel might \\nhave done to get himself into a book. he wasn’t in \\ngreat wizards of the twentieth century, or notable \\nmagical names of our time ; he was missing, too, from \\nimportant modern magical discoveries, and a study of \\nrecent developments in wizardry. and then, of \\ncourse, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of \\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds \\nof narrow rows. \\n\\nhermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had \\ndecided to search while ron strode off down a row of \\nbooks and started pulling them off the shelves at \\nrandom. harry wandered over to the restricted \\nsection. he had been wondering for a while if flamel \\nwasn’t somewhere in there. unfortunately, you \\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the \\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he \\nknew he’d never get one. these were the books \\ncontaining powerful dark magic never taught at \\nhogwarts, and only read by older students studying \\nadvanced defense against the dark arts. \\n\\n“what are you looking for, boy?” \\n\\n“nothing,” said harry. \\n\\npage | 221 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmadam pince the librarian brandished a feather \\nduster at him. \\n\\n“you’d better get out, then. go on — out!” \\n\\nwishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some \\nstory, harry left the library. he, ron, and hermione \\nhad already agreed they’d better not ask madam \\npince where they could find flamel. they were sure \\nshe’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk \\nsnape hearing what they were up to. \\n\\nharry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other \\ntwo had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. \\nthey had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as \\nthey only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t \\nsurprising they’d found nothing. what they really \\nneeded was a nice long search without madam pince \\nbreathing down their necks. \\n\\nfive minutes later, ron and hermione joined him, \\nshaking their heads. they went off to lunch. \\n\\n“you will keep looking while i’m away, won’t you?” \\nsaid hermione. “and send me an owl if you find \\nanything.” \\n\\n“and you could ask your parents if they know who \\nflamel is,” said ron. “it’d be safe to ask them.” \\n\\n“very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said hermione. \\n\\nonce the holidays had started, ron and harry were \\nhaving too good a time to think much about flamel. \\nthey had the dormitory to themselves and the \\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they \\nwere able to get the good armchairs by the fire. they \\nsat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a \\ntoasting fork — bread, english muffins, \\n\\npage | 222 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmarshmallows — and plotting ways of getting malfoy \\nexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if they \\nwouldn’t work. \\n\\nron also started teaching harry wizard chess. this \\nwas exactly like muggle chess except that the figures \\nwere alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in \\nbattle. ron’s set was very old and battered. like \\neverything else he owned, it had once belonged to \\nsomeone else in his family — in this case, his \\ngrandfather. however, old chessmen weren’t a \\ndrawback at all. ron knew them so well he never had \\ntrouble getting them to do what he wanted. \\n\\nharry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had \\nlent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. he wasn’t a \\nvery good player yet and they kept shouting different \\nbits of advice at him, which was confusing. “don’t \\nsend me there, can’t you see his knight? send him, we \\ncan afford to lose him.” \\n\\non christmas eve, harry went to bed looking forward \\nto the next day for the food and the fun, but not \\nexpecting any presents at all. when he woke early in \\nthe morning, however, the first thing he saw was a \\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \\n\\n“merry christmas,” said ron sleepily as harry \\nscrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \\n\\n“you, too,” said harry. “will you look at this? i’ve got \\nsome presents!” \\n\\n“what did you expect, turnips?” said ron, turning to \\nhis own pile, which was a lot bigger than harry’s. \\n\\nharry picked up the top parcel. it was wrapped in \\nthick brown paper and scrawled across it was to \\nharry, from hagrid. inside was a roughly cut wooden \\n\\npage | 223 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nflute. hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. harry \\nblew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. \\n\\na second, very small parcel contained a note. \\n\\nwe received your message and enclose your christmas \\npresent. from uncle vernon and aunt petunia. taped \\nto the note was a fifty-pence piece. \\n\\n“that’s friendly,” said harry. \\n\\nron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \\n\\n“ weird\\\\ ” he said, “what a shape! this is money?” \\n\\n“you can keep it,” said harry, laughing at how \\npleased ron was. “hagrid and my aunt and uncle — \\nso who sent these?” \\n\\n“i think i know who that one’s from,” said ron, \\nturning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy \\nparcel. “my mom. i told her you didn’t expect any \\npresents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you \\na weasley sweater.” \\n\\nharry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- \\nknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of \\nhomemade fudge. \\n\\n“every year she makes us a sweater,” said ron, \\nunwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.” \\n\\n“that’s really nice of her,” said harry, trying the \\nfudge, which was very tasty. \\n\\nhis next present also contained candy — a large box \\nof chocolate frogs from hermione. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 224 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthis only left one parcel. harry picked it up and felt \\nit. it was very light. he unwrapped it. \\n\\nsomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the \\nfloor where it lay in gleaming folds. ron gasped. \\n\\n“i’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, \\ndropping the box of every flavor beans he’d gotten \\nfrom hermione. “if that’s what i think it is — they’re \\nreally rare, and really valuable.” \\n\\n“what is it?” \\n\\nharry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. it \\nwas strange to the touch, like water woven into \\nmaterial. \\n\\n“it’s an invisibility cloak,” said ron, a look of awe on \\nhis face. “i’m sure it is — try it on.” \\n\\nharry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron \\ngave a yell. \\n\\n“it is! look down!” \\n\\nharry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. he \\ndashed to the mirror. sure enough, his reflection \\nlooked back at him, just his head suspended in \\nmidair, his body completely invisible. he pulled the \\ncloak over his head and his reflection vanished \\ncompletely. \\n\\n“there’s a note!” said ron suddenly. “a note fell out of \\nit!” \\n\\n\\n\\nharry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. \\nwritten in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen \\nbefore were the following words: \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 225 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyour father left this in my possession before he died. it \\nis time it was returned to you. \\n\\nuse it well. \\n\\na very merry christmas to you. \\n\\nthere was no signature. harry stared at the note. ron \\nwas admiring the cloak. \\n\\n“i’d give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. “anuthinq. \\nwhat’s the matter?” \\n\\n“nothing,” said harry. he felt very strange. who had \\nsent the cloak? had it really once belonged to his \\nfather? \\n\\nbefore he could say or think anything else, the \\ndormitory door was flung open and fred and george \\nweasley bounded in. harry stuffed the cloak quickly \\nout of sight. he didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone \\nelse yet. \\n\\n“merry christmas!” \\n\\n“hey, look — harry’s got a weasley sweater, too!” \\n\\nfred and george were wearing blue sweaters, one \\nwith a large yellow f on it, the other a g. \\n\\n“harry’s is better than ours, though,” said fred, \\nholding up harry’s sweater. “she obviously makes \\nmore of an effort if you’re not family.” \\n\\n“why aren’t you wearing yours, ron?” george \\ndemanded. “come on, get it on, they’re lovely and \\nwarm.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 226 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i hate maroon,” ron moaned halfheartedly as he \\npulled it over his head. \\n\\n“you haven’t got a letter on yours,” george observed. \\n\\n“i suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. but \\nwe’re not stupid — we know we’re called gred and \\nforge.” \\n\\n“what’s all this noise?” \\n\\npercy weasley stuck his head through the door, \\nlooking disapproving. he had clearly gotten halfway \\nthrough unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a \\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which fred seized. \\n\\n“p for prefect! get it on, percy, come on, we’re all \\nwearing ours, even harry got one.” \\n\\n“i — don’t — want — ” said percy thickly, as the twins \\nforced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses \\naskew. \\n\\n“and you’re not sitting with the prefects today, \\neither,” said george. “christmas is a time for family.” \\n\\nthey frog-marched percy from the room, his arms \\npinned to his side by his sweater. \\n\\nharry had never in all his life had such a christmas \\ndinner. a hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of \\nroast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; \\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich \\ngravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard \\ncrackers every few feet along the table. these \\nfantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble \\nmuggle ones the dursleys usually bought, with their \\nlittle plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. \\nharry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn’t \\njust bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and \\npage | 227 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nengulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from \\nthe inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several \\nlive, white mice. up at the high table, dumbledore \\nhad swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered \\nbonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor \\nflitwick had just read him. \\n\\nflaming christmas puddings followed the turkey. \\npercy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle \\nembedded in his slice. harry watched hagrid getting \\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more \\nwine, finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the \\ncheek, who, to harry’s amazement, giggled and \\nblushed, her top hat lopsided. \\n\\nwhen harry finally left the table, he was laden down \\nwith a stack of things out of the crackers, including a \\npack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a grow- \\nyour-own-warts kit, and his own new wizard chess \\nset. the white mice had disappeared and harry had a \\nnasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs. \\nnorris’s christmas dinner. \\n\\nharry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon \\nhaving a furious snowball fight on the grounds. then, \\ncold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the \\nfire in the gryffindor common room, where harry \\nbroke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to \\nron. he suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if \\npercy hadn’t tried to help him so much. \\n\\nafter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, \\nand christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy \\nto do much before bed except sit and watch percy \\nchase fred and george all over gryffindor tower \\nbecause they’d stolen his prefect badge. \\n\\nit had been harry’s best christmas day ever. yet \\nsomething had been nagging at the back of his mind \\n\\npage | 228 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall day. not until he climbed into bed was he free to \\nthink about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had \\nsent it. \\n\\nron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing \\nmysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon \\nas he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. harry \\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the \\ncloak out from under it. \\n\\nhis father’s ... this had been his father’s. he let the \\nmaterial flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light \\nas air. use it well, the note had said. \\n\\nhe had to try it, now. he slipped out of bed and \\nwrapped the cloak around himself. looking down at \\nhis legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. it was a \\nvery funny feeling. \\n\\nuse it well. \\n\\nsuddenly, harry felt wide-awake. the whole of \\nhogwarts was open to him in this cloak. excitement \\nflooded through him as he stood there in the dark \\nand silence. he could go anywhere in this, anywhere, \\nand filch would never know. \\n\\nron grunted in his sleep. should harry wake him? \\nsomething held him back — his father’s cloak — he \\nfelt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use \\nit alone. \\n\\nhe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across \\nthe common room, and climbed through the portrait \\nhole. \\n\\n“who’s there?” squawked the fat lady. harry said \\nnothing. he walked quickly down the corridor. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 229 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere should he go? he stopped, his heart racing, \\nand thought. and then it came to him. the restricted \\nsection in the library. he’d be able to read as long as \\nhe liked, as long as it took to find out who flamel \\nwas. he set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight \\naround him as he walked. \\n\\nthe library was pitch-black and very eerie. harry lit a \\nlamp to see his way along the rows of books. the \\nlamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and \\neven though harry could feel his arm supporting it, \\nthe sight gave him the creeps. \\n\\nthe restricted section was right at the back of the \\nlibrary. stepping carefully over the rope that \\nseparated these books from the rest of the library, he \\nheld up his lamp to read the titles. \\n\\nthey didn’t tell him much. their peeling, faded gold \\nletters spelled words in languages harry couldn’t \\nunderstand. some had no title at all. one book had a \\ndark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. the \\nhairs on the back of harry’s neck prickled. maybe he \\nwas imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint \\nwhispering was coming from the books, as though \\nthey knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. \\n\\nhe had to start somewhere. setting the lamp down \\ncarefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom \\nshelf for an interesting-looking book. a large black \\nand silver volume caught his eye. he pulled it out \\nwith difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, \\nbalancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \\n\\na piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — \\nthe book was screaming! harry snapped it shut, but \\nthe shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, \\nearsplitting note. he stumbled backward and knocked \\nover his lamp, which went out at once. panicking, he \\npage | 230 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — \\nstuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran \\nfor it. he passed filch in the doorway; filch’s pale, \\nwild eyes looked straight through him, and harry \\nslipped under filch’s outstretched arm and streaked \\noff up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in \\nhis ears. \\n\\nhe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of \\narmor. he had been so busy getting away from the \\nlibrary, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was \\ngoing. perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t \\nrecognize where he was at all. there was a suit of \\narmor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be \\nfive floors above there. \\n\\n“you asked me to come directly to you, professor, if \\nanyone was wandering around at night, and \\nsomebody’s been in the library — restricted section.” \\n\\nharry felt the blood drain out of his face. wherever he \\nwas, filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, \\ngreasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it \\nwas snape who replied, “the restricted section? well, \\nthey can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” \\n\\nharry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape \\ncame around the corner ahead. they couldn’t see \\nhim, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if \\nthey came much nearer they’d knock right into him — \\nthe cloak didn’t stop him from being solid. \\n\\nhe backed away as quietly as he could. a door stood \\najar to his left. it was his only hope. he squeezed \\nthrough it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, \\nand to his relief he managed to get inside the room \\nwithout their noticing anything. they walked straight \\npast, and harry leaned against the wall, breathing \\ndeeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. that \\npage | 231 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhad been close, very close. it was a few seconds \\nbefore he noticed anything about the room he had \\nhidden in. \\n\\n\\n\\nit looked like an unused classroom. the dark shapes \\nof desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and \\nthere was an upturned wastepaper basket — but \\npropped against the wall facing him was something \\nthat didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that \\nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it \\nout of the way. \\n\\nit was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, \\nwith an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed \\nfeet. there was an inscription carved around the top: \\nerised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. \\n\\nhis panic fading now that there was no sound of filch \\nand snape, harry moved nearer to the mirror, \\nwanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. \\nhe stepped in front of it. \\n\\nhe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself \\nfrom screaming. he whirled around. his heart was \\npounding far more furiously than when the book had \\nscreamed — for he had seen not only himself in the \\nmirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right \\nbehind him. \\n\\nbut the room was empty. breathing very fast, he \\nturned slowly back to the mirror. \\n\\nthere he was, reflected in it, white and scared- \\nlooking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least \\nten others. harry looked over his shoulder — but still, \\nno one was there. or were they all invisible, too? was \\nhe in fact in a room full of invisible people and this \\nmirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or \\nnot? \\n\\npage | 232 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhe looked in the mirror again. a woman standing \\nright behind his reflection was smiling at him and \\nwaving. he reached out a hand and felt the air behind \\nhim. if she was really there, he’d touch her, their \\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air \\n— she and the others existed only in the mirror. \\n\\nshe was a very pretty woman. she had dark red hair \\nand her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, harry \\nthought, edging a little closer to the glass. bright \\ngreen — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed \\nthat she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same \\ntime. the tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \\nto her put his arm around her. he wore glasses, and \\nhis hair was very untidy. it stuck up at the back, just \\nas harry’s did. \\n\\nharry was so close to the mirror now that his nose \\nwas nearly touching that of his reflection. \\n\\n“mom?” he whispered. “dad?” \\n\\nthey just looked at him, smiling. and slowly, harry \\nlooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, \\nand saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses \\nlike his, even a little old man who looked as though \\nhe had harry’s knobbly knees — harry was looking at \\nhis family, for the first time in his life. \\n\\nthe potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared \\nhungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against \\nthe glass as though he was hoping to fall right \\nthrough it and reach them. he had a powerful kind of \\nache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \\n\\nhow long he stood there, he didn’t know. the \\nreflections did not fade and he looked and looked \\nuntil a distant noise brought him back to his senses. \\nhe couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to \\n\\npage | 233 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbed. he tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, \\nwhispered, “i’ll come back,” and hurried from the \\nroom. \\n\\n“you could have woken me up,” said ron, crossly. \\n\\n“you can come tonight, i’m going back, i want to show \\nyou the mirror.” \\n\\n“i’d like to see your mom and dad,” ron said eagerly. \\n\\n“and i want to see all your family, all the weasleys, \\nyou’ll be able to show me your other brothers and \\neveryone.” \\n\\n“you can see them any old time,” said ron. “just \\ncome round my house this summer. anyway, maybe \\nit only shows dead people. shame about not finding \\nflamel, though. have some bacon or something, why \\naren’t you eating anything?” \\n\\nharry couldn’t eat. he had seen his parents and \\nwould be seeing them again tonight. he had almost \\nforgotten about flamel. it didn’t seem very important \\nanymore. who cared what the three-headed dog was \\nguarding? what did it matter if snape stole it, really? \\n\\n“are you all right?” said ron. “you look odd.” \\n\\nwhat harry feared most was that he might not be \\nable to find the mirror room again. with ron covered \\nin the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly \\nthe next night. they tried retracing harry’s route from \\nthe library, wandering around the dark passageways \\nfor nearly an hour. \\n\\n“i’m freezing,” said ron. “let’s forget it and go back.” \\n\\n“ivo!” harry hissed. “i know it’s here somewhere.” \\n\\npage | 234 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the \\nopposite direction, but saw no one else. just as ron \\nstarted moaning that his feet were dead with cold, \\nharry spotted the suit of armor. \\n\\n“it’s here — just here — yes!” \\n\\nthey pushed the door open. harry dropped the cloak \\nfrom around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \\n\\nthere they were. his mother and father beamed at the \\nsight of him. \\n\\n“see?” harry whispered. \\n\\n“i can’t see anything.” \\n\\n“look! look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” \\n“i can only see you.” \\n\\n“look in it properly, go on, stand where i am.” \\n\\nharry stepped aside, but with ron in front of the \\nmirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just ron \\nin his paisley pajamas. \\n\\nron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \\n“look at me!” he said. \\n\\n“can you see all your family standing around you?” \\n\\n“no — i’m alone — but i’m different — i look older — \\nand i’m head boy!” \\n\\n“what?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 235 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i am — i’m wearing the badge like bill used to — and \\ni’m holding the house cup and the quidditch cup — \\ni’m quidditch captain, too!” \\n\\nron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to \\nlook excitedly at harry. \\n\\n“do you think this mirror shows the future?” \\n\\n“how can it? all my family are dead — let me have \\nanother look — ” \\n\\n“you had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit \\nmore time.” \\n\\n“you’re only holding the quidditch cup, what’s \\ninteresting about that? i want to see my parents.” \\n\\n“don’t push me — ” \\n\\na sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to \\ntheir discussion. they hadn’t realized how loudly they \\nhad been talking. \\n\\n“quick!” \\n\\nron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous \\neyes of mrs. norris came round the door. ron and \\nharry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing \\n— did the cloak work on cats? after what seemed an \\nage, she turned and left. \\n\\n“this isn’t safe — she might have gone for filch, i bet \\nshe heard us. come on.” \\n\\nand ron pulled harry out of the room. \\n\\nthe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 236 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“want to play chess, harry?” said ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“no.” \\n\\n“why don’t we go down and visit hagrid?” \\n\\n“no ... you go ...” \\n\\n“i know what you’re thinking about, harry, that \\nmirror. don’t go back tonight.” \\n\\n“why not?” \\n\\n“i dunno, i’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and \\nanyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. \\nfilch, snape, and mrs. norris are wandering around. \\nso what if they can’t see you? what if they walk into \\nyou? what if you knock something over?” \\n\\n“you sound like hermione.” \\n\\n“i’m serious, harry, don’t go.” \\n\\nbut harry only had one thought in his head, which \\nwas to get back in front of the mirror, and ron wasn’t \\ngoing to stop him. \\n\\nthat third night he found his way more quickly than \\nbefore. he was walking so fast he knew he was \\nmaking more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet \\nanyone. \\n\\nand there were his mother and father smiling at him \\nagain, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. \\nharry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the \\nmirror. there was nothing to stop him from staying \\nhere all night with his family. nothing at all. \\n\\nexcept — \\n\\npage | 237 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“so — back again, harry?” \\n\\nharry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. he \\nlooked behind him. sitting on one of the desks by the \\nwall was none other than albus dumbledore. harry \\nmust have walked straight past him, so desperate to \\nget to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him. \\n\\n“i — i didn’t see you, sir.” \\n\\n“strange how nearsighted being invisible can make \\nyou,” said dumbledore, and harry was relieved to see \\nthat he was smiling. \\n\\n“so,” said dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on \\nthe floor with harry, “you, like hundreds before you, \\nhave discovered the delights of the mirror of erised.” \\n\\n“i didn’t know it was called that, sir.” \\n\\n“but i expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” \\n\\n“it — well — it shows me my family — ” \\n\\n“and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy.” \\n\\n“how did you know — ?” \\n\\n“i don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said \\ndumbledore gently. “now, can you think what the \\nmirror of erised shows us all?” \\n\\nharry shook his head. \\n\\n“let me explain. the happiest man on earth would be \\nable to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror, \\nthat is, he would look into it and see himself exactly \\nas he is. does that help?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 238 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry thought. then he said slowly, “it shows us \\nwhat we want ... whatever we want ...” \\n\\n“yes and no,” said dumbledore quietly. “it shows us \\nnothing more or less than the deepest, most \\ndesperate desire of our hearts. you, who have never \\nknown your family, see them standing around you. \\nronald weasley, who has always been overshadowed \\nby his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best \\nof all of them. however, this mirror will give us \\nneither knowledge or truth. men have wasted away \\nbefore it, entranced by what they have seen, or been \\ndriven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or \\neven possible. \\n\\n“the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, \\nharry, and i ask you not to go looking for it again. if \\nyou ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. it \\ndoes not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, \\nremember that. now, why don’t you put that \\nadmirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” \\n\\nharry stood up. \\n\\n“sir — professor dumbledore? can i ask you \\nsomething?” \\n\\n“obviously, you’ve just done so,” dumbledore smiled. \\n“you may ask me one more thing, however.” \\n\\n“what do you see when you look in the mirror?” \\n\\n“i? i see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” \\n\\nharry stared. \\n\\n“one can never have enough socks,” said \\ndumbledore. “another christmas has come and gone \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 239 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand i didn’t get a single pair. people will insist on \\ngiving me books.” \\n\\nit was only when he was back in bed that it struck \\nharry that dumbledore might not have been quite \\ntruthful. but then, he thought, as he shoved \\nscabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal \\nquestion. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 240 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnicholas flambl \\n\\ndumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking \\nfor the mirror of erised again, and for the rest of the \\nchristmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed \\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. harry wished he \\ncould forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, \\nbut he couldn’t. he started having nightmares. over \\nand over again he dreamed about his parents \\ndisappearing in a flash of green light, while a high \\nvoice cackled with laughter. \\n\\n“you see, dumbledore was right, that mirror could \\ndrive you mad,” said ron, when harry told him about \\nthese dreams. \\n\\nhermione, who came back the day before term \\nstarted, took a different view of things. she was torn \\nbetween horror at the idea of harry being out of bed, \\nroaming the school three nights in a row (“if filch had \\ncaught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at \\nleast found out who nicolas flamel was. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 241 \\n\\n\\n\\nthey had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel \\nin a library book, even though harry was still sure \\nhe’d read the name somewhere. once term had \\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books \\nfor ten minutes during their breaks. harry had even \\nless time than the other two, because quidditch \\npractice had started again. \\n\\nwood was working the team harder than ever. even \\nthe endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t \\ndampen his spirits. the weasleys complained that \\nwood was becoming a fanatic, but harry was on \\nwood’s side. if they won their next match, against \\nhufflepuff, they would overtake slytherin in the \\nhouse championship for the first time in seven years. \\nquite apart from wanting to win, harry found that he \\nhad fewer nightmares when he was tired out after \\ntraining. \\n\\nthen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice \\nsession, wood gave the team a bit of bad news. he’d \\njust gotten very angry with the weasleys, who kept \\ndive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off \\ntheir brooms. \\n\\n“will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “that’s \\nexactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! \\nsnape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for \\nany excuse to knock points off gryffindor!” \\n\\ngeorge weasley really did fall off his broom at these \\nwords. \\n\\n“ snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a \\nmouthful of mud. “when’s he ever refereed a \\nquidditch match? he’s not going to be fair if we might \\novertake slytherin.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 242 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe rest of the team landed next to george to \\ncomplain, too. \\n\\n“it’s not my fault,” said wood. “we’ve just got to make \\nsure we play a clean game, so snape hasn’t got an \\nexcuse to pick on us.” \\n\\nwhich was all very well, thought harry, but he had \\nanother reason for not wanting snape near him while \\nhe was playing quidditch. ... \\n\\nthe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another \\nas usual at the end of practice, but harry headed \\nstraight back to the gryffindor common room, where \\nhe found ron and hermione playing chess. chess was \\nthe only thing hermione ever lost at, something harry \\nand ron thought was very good for her. \\n\\n“don’t talk to me for a moment,” said ron when harry \\nsat down next to him, “i need to concern” he caught \\nsight of harry’s face. “what’s the matter with you? \\n\\nyou look terrible.” \\n\\nspeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, \\n\\nharry told the other two about snape ’s sudden, \\nsinister desire to be a quidditch referee. \\n\\n“don’t play,” said hermione at once. \\n\\n“say you’re ill,” said ron. \\n\\n“pretend to break your leg,” hermione suggested. \\n\\n“ really break your leg,” said ron. \\n\\n“i can’t,” said harry. “there isn’t a reserve seeker. if i \\nback out, gryffindor can’t play at all.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 243 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat that moment neville toppled into the common \\nroom. how he had managed to climb through the \\nportrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs \\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at \\nonce as the leg-locker curse. he must have had to \\nbunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower. \\n\\neveryone fell over laughing except hermione, who \\nleapt up and performed the countercurse. neville’s \\nlegs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \\n\\n“what happened?” hermione asked him, leading him \\nover to sit with harry and ron. \\n\\n“malfoy,” said neville shakily. “i met him outside the \\nlibrary. he said he’d been looking for someone to \\npractice that on.” \\n\\n“go to professor mcgonagall!” hermione urged \\nneville. “report him!” \\n\\nneville shook his head. \\n\\n“i don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. \\n\\n“you’ve got to stand up to him, neville!” said ron. \\n“he’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no \\nreason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.” \\n\\n“there’s no need to tell me i’m not brave enough to be \\nin gryffindor, malfoy’s already done that,” neville \\nchoked out. \\n\\nharry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a \\nchocolate frog, the very last one from the box \\nhermione had given him for christmas. he gave it to \\nneville, who looked as though he might cry. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 244 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you’re worth twelve of malfoy,” harry said. “the \\nsorting hat chose you for gryffindor, didn’t it? and \\nwhere’s malfoy? in stinking slytherin.” \\n\\nneville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he \\nunwrapped the frog. \\n\\n“thanks, harry ... i think i’ll go to bed. ... d’you want \\nthe card, you collect them, don’t you?” \\n\\nas neville walked away, harry looked at the famous \\nwizard card. \\n\\n“dumbledore again,” he said, “he was the first one i \\never — ” \\n\\nhe gasped. he stared at the back of the card. then he \\nlooked up at ron and hermione. \\n\\n“i’ve found him\\\\” he whispered. “i’ve found flamel! i \\ntold you i’d read the name somewhere before, i read it \\non the train coming here — listen to this: \\n\\n‘dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of \\nthe dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the \\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his \\nwork on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel’v’ \\n\\nhermione jumped to her feet. she hadn’t looked so \\nexcited since they’d gotten back the marks for their \\nvery first piece of homework. \\n\\n“stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs \\nto the girls’ dormitories. harry and ron barely had \\ntime to exchange mystified looks before she was \\ndashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \\n\\n“i never thought to look in here!” she whispered \\nexcitedly. “i got this out of the library weeks ago for a \\nbit of light reading.” \\n\\npage | 245 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“light?” said ron, but hermione told him to be quiet \\nuntil she’d looked something up, and started flicking \\nfrantically through the pages, muttering to herself. \\n\\nat last she found what she was looking for. \\n\\n“i knew it! i knew it!” \\n\\n“are we allowed to speak yet?” said ron grumpily. \\nhermione ignored him. \\n\\n“nicolas flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the \\nonly known maker of the sorcerer’s stone\\\\” \\n\\nthis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected. \\n\\n“the what?” said harry and ron. \\n\\n“oh, honestly , don’t you two read? look — read that, \\nthere.” \\n\\nshe pushed the book toward them, and harry and \\nron read: \\n\\nthe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with \\nmaking the sorcerer’s stone, a legendary substance \\nwith astonishing powers. the stone will transform \\nany metal into pure gold. it also produces the elixir of \\nlife, which will make the drinker immortal. \\n\\nthere have been many reports of the sorcerer’s stone \\nover the centuries, but the only stone currently in \\nexistence belongs to mr. nicolas flamel, the noted \\nalchemist and opera lover. mr. flamel, who celebrated \\nhis six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, \\nenjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife, perenelle \\n(six hundred and fifty-eight). \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 246 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“see?” said hermione, when harry and ron had \\nfinished. “the dog must be guarding flamel’s \\nsorcerer’s stone! i bet he asked dumbledore to keep \\nit safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew \\nsomeone was after it, that’s why he wanted the stone \\nmoved out of gringotts!” \\n\\n“a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever \\ndying!” said harry. “no wonder snape’s after it! \\n\\nanyone would want it.” \\n\\n“and no wonder we couldn’t find flamel in that study \\nof recent developments in wizardry,” said ron. “he’s \\nnot exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is \\nhe?” \\n\\nthe next morning in defense against the dark arts, \\nwhile copying down different ways of treating werewolf \\nbites, harry and ron were still discussing what they’d \\ndo with a sorcerer’s stone if they had one. it wasn’t \\nuntil ron said he’d buy his own quidditch team that \\nharry remembered about snape and the coming \\nmatch. \\n\\n“i’m going to play,” he told ron and hermione. “if i \\ndon’t, all the slytherins will think i’m just too scared \\nto face snape. i’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the \\nsmiles off their faces if we win.” \\n\\n“just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” \\nsaid hermione. \\n\\nas the match drew nearer, however, harry became \\nmore and more nervous, whatever he told ron and \\nhermione. the rest of the team wasn’t too calm, \\neither. the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house \\nchampionship was wonderful, no one had done it for \\nseven years, but would they be allowed to, with such \\na biased referee? \\n\\npage | 247 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, \\nbut he seemed to keep running into snape wherever \\nhe went. at times, he even wondered whether snape \\nwas following him, trying to catch him on his own. \\npotions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly \\ntorture, snape was so horrible to harry. could snape \\npossibly know they’d found out about the sorcerer’s \\nstone? harry didn’t see how he could — yet he \\nsometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could \\nread minds. \\n\\nharry knew, when they wished him good luck \\noutside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that ron \\nand hermione were wondering whether they’d ever \\nsee him alive again. this wasn’t what you’d call \\ncomforting. harry hardly heard a word of wood’s pep \\ntalk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked \\nup his nimbus two thousand. \\n\\nron and hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in \\nthe stands next to neville, who couldn’t understand \\nwhy they looked so grim and worried, or why they had \\nboth brought their wands to the match. little did \\nharry know that ron and hermione had been secretly \\npracticing the leg-locker curse. they’d gotten the \\nidea from malfoy using it on neville, and were ready \\nto use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to \\nhurt harry. \\n\\n“now, don’t forget, it’s locomotor mortis,” hermione \\nmuttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \\n\\n“i know,” ron snapped. “don’t nag.” \\n\\nback in the locker room, wood had taken harry \\naside. \\n\\n“don’t want to pressure you, potter, but if we ever \\nneed an early capture of the snitch it’s now. finish \\n\\npage | 248 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe game before snape can favor hufflepuff too \\nmuch.” \\n\\n“the whole school’s out there!” said fred weasley, \\npeering out of the door. “even — blimey — \\ndumbledore’s come to watch!” \\n\\nharry’s heart did a somersault. \\n\\n“dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make \\nsure. fred was right. there was no mistaking that \\nsilver beard. \\n\\nharry could have laughed out loud with relief. he was \\nsafe. there was simply no way that snape would dare \\nto try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching. \\n\\nperhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as \\nthe teams marched onto the field, something that ron \\nnoticed, too. \\n\\n“i’ve never seen snape look so mean,” he told \\nhermione. “look — they’re off. ouch!” \\n\\nsomeone had poked ron in the back of the head. it \\nwas malfoy. \\n\\n“oh, sorry, weasley, didn’t see you there.” \\n\\nmalfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle. \\n\\n“wonder how long potter’s going to stay on his broom \\nthis time? anyone want a bet? what about you, \\nweasley?” \\n\\nron didn’t answer; snape had just awarded \\nhufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit \\na bludger at him. hermione, who had all her fingers \\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at harry, \\n\\npage | 249 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the \\nsnitch. \\n\\n“you know how i think they choose people for the \\ngryffindor team?” said malfoy loudly a few minutes \\nlater, as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty \\nfor no reason at all. “it’s people they feel sorry for. \\n\\nsee, there’s potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s \\nthe weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be \\non the team, longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” \\n\\nneville went bright red but turned in his seat to face \\nmalfoy. \\n\\n“i’m worth twelve of you, malfoy,” he stammered. \\n\\nmalfoy, crabbe, and goyle howled with laughter, but \\nron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, \\nsaid, “you tell him, neville.” \\n\\n“longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than \\nweasley, and that’s saying something.” \\n\\nron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking \\npoint with anxiety about harry. \\n\\n“i’m warning you, malfoy — one more word — ” \\n\\n“ron!” said hermione suddenly, “harry — !” \\n\\n“what? where?” \\n\\nharry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, \\nwhich drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. \\nhermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, \\nas harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \\n\\n“you’re in luck, weasley, potter’s obviously spotted \\nsome money on the ground!” said malfoy. \\n\\npage | 250 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nron snapped. before malfoy knew what was \\nhappening, ron was on top of him, wrestling him to \\nthe ground. neville hesitated, then clambered over the \\nback of his seat to help. \\n\\n“come on, harry!” hermione screamed, leaping onto \\nher seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape — \\nshe didn’t even notice malfoy and ron rolling around \\nunder her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from \\nthe whirl of fists that was neville, crabbe, and goyle. \\n\\nup in the air, snape turned on his broomstick just in \\ntime to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing \\nhim by inches — the next second, harry had pulled \\nout of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the snitch \\nclasped in his hand. \\n\\nthe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one \\ncould ever remember the snitch being caught so \\nquickly. \\n\\n“ron! ron! where are you? the game’s over! harry’s \\nwon! we’ve won! gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked \\nhermione, dancing up and down on her seat and \\nhugging parvati patil in the row in front. \\n\\nharry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. \\nhe couldn’t believe it. he’d done it — the game was \\nover; it had barely lasted five minutes. as gryffindors \\ncame spilling onto the field, he saw snape land \\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then harry felt \\na hand on his shoulder and looked up into \\ndumbledore’s smiling face. \\n\\n“well done,” said dumbledore quietly, so that only \\nharry could hear. “nice to see you haven’t been \\nbrooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . \\nexcellent ...” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 251 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsnape spat bitterly on the ground. \\n\\n\\n\\njc jc jc \\n\\n\\n\\nharry left the locker room alone some time later, to \\ntake his nimbus two thousand back to the \\nbroomshed. he couldn’t ever remember feeling \\nhappier. he’d really done something to be proud of \\nnow — no one could say he was just a famous name \\nany more. the evening air had never smelled so \\nsweet. he walked over the damp grass, reliving the \\nlast hour in his head, which was a happy blur: \\ngryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; \\nron and hermione in the distance, jumping up and \\ndown, ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \\n\\nharry had reached the shed. he leaned against the \\nwooden door and looked up at hogwarts, with its \\nwindows glowing red in the setting sun. gryffindor in \\nthe lead. he’d done it, he’d shown snape. ... \\n\\nand speaking of snape . . . \\n\\na hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of \\nthe castle. clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked \\nas fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. \\nharry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. \\nhe recognized the figure’s prowling walk. snape, \\nsneaking into the forest while everyone else was at \\ndinner — what was going on? \\n\\nharry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand \\nand took off. gliding silently over the castle he saw \\nsnape enter the forest at a run. he followed. \\n\\nthe trees were so thick he couldn’t see where snape \\nhad gone. he flew in circles, lower and lower, \\nbrushing the top branches of trees until he heard \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 252 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvoices. he glided toward them and landed noiselessly \\nin a towering beech tree. \\n\\nhe climbed carefully along one of the branches, \\nholding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through \\nthe leaves. \\n\\nbelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood snape, but he \\nwasn’t alone. quirrell was there, too. harry couldn’t \\nmake out the look on his face, but he was stuttering \\nworse than ever. harry strained to catch what they \\nwere saying. \\n\\n\"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of \\nall p-places, severus ...” \\n\\n“oh, i thought we’d keep this private,” said snape, his \\nvoice icy. “students aren’t supposed to know about \\nthe sorcerer’s stone, after all.” \\n\\nharry leaned forward. quirrell was mumbling \\nsomething. snape interrupted him. \\n\\n“have you found out how to get past that beast of \\nhagrid’s yet?” \\n\\n“b-b-but severus, i — ” \\n\\n“you don’t want me as your enemy, quirrell,” said \\nsnape, taking a step toward him. \\n\\n“i-i don’t know what you — ” \\n\\n“you know perfectly well what i mean.” \\n\\nan owl hooted loudly, and harry nearly fell out of the \\ntree. he steadied himself in time to hear snape say, \\n\\n“ — your little bit of hocus-pocus. i’m waiting.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 253 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“b-but i d-d-don’t — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“very well,” snape cut in. “well have another little \\nchat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over \\nand decided where your loyalties lie.” \\n\\nhe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the \\nclearing. it was almost dark now, but harry could see \\nquirrell, standing quite still as though he was \\npetrified. \\n\\n\\n\\njc jc jc \\n\\n\\n\\n“harry, where have you been?” hermione squeaked. \\n\\n“we won! you won! we won!” shouted ron, thumping \\nharry on the back. “and i gave malfoy a black eye, \\nand neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single- \\nhanded! he’s still out cold but madam pomfrey says \\nhe’ll be all right — talk about showing slytherin! \\neveryone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re \\nhaving a party, fred and george stole some cakes and \\nstuff from the kitchens.” \\n\\n“never mind that now,” said harry breathlessly. “let’s \\nfind an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” \\n\\nhe made sure peeves wasn’t inside before shutting \\nthe door behind them, then he told them what he’d \\nseen and heard. \\n\\n“so we were right, it is the sorcerer’s stone, and \\nsnape’s trying to force quirrell to help him get it. he \\nasked if he knew how to get past fluffy — and he said \\nsomething about quirrell’s ‘hocus-pocus’ — i reckon \\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from \\nfluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and quirrell \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 254 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwould have done some anti-dark arts spell that \\nsnape needs to break through — ” \\n\\n“so you mean the stone’s only safe as long as quirrell \\nstands up to snape?” said hermione in alarm. \\n\\n“it’ll be gone by next tuesday,” said ron. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 255 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnorbert the norwegian \\nridgeback \\n\\nquirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d \\nthought. in the weeks that followed he did seem to be \\ngetting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though \\nhe’d cracked yet. \\n\\nevery time they passed the third-floor corridor, harry, \\nron, and hermione would press their ears to the door \\nto check that fluffy was still growling inside. snape \\nwas sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which \\nsurely meant that the stone was still safe. whenever \\nharry passed quirrell these days he gave him an \\nencouraging sort of smile, and ron had started telling \\npeople off for laughing at quirrell’s stutter. \\n\\nhermione, however, had more on her mind than the \\nsorcerer’s stone. she had started drawing up study \\nschedules and color-coding all her notes. harry and \\nron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging \\nthem to do the same. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 256 \\n\\n\\n\\n“hermione, the exams are ages away.” \\n\\n“ten weeks,” hermione snapped. “that’s not ages, \\nthat’s like a second to nicolas flamel.” \\n\\n“but we’re not six hundred years old,” ron reminded \\nher. “anyway, what are you studying for, you already \\nknow it all.” \\n\\n“what am i studying for? are you crazy? you realize \\nwe need to pass these exams to get into the second \\nyear? they’re very important, i should have started \\nstudying a month ago, i don’t know what’s gotten into \\nme.” \\n\\nunfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking \\nalong the same lines as hermione. they piled so \\nmuch homework on them that the easter holidays \\nweren’t nearly as much fun as the christmas ones. it \\nwas hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting \\nthe twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand \\nmovements. moaning and yawning, harry and ron \\nspent most of their free time in the library with her, \\ntrying to get through all their extra work. \\n\\n“i’ll never remember this,” ron burst out one \\nafternoon, throwing down his quill and looking \\nlongingly out of the library window. it was the first \\nreally fine day they’d had in months. the sky was a \\nclear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in \\nthe air of summer coming. \\n\\nharry, who was looking up “dittany” in one thousand \\nmagical herbs and fungi, didn’t look up until he \\nheard ron say, “hagrid! what are you doing in the \\nlibrary?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 257 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind \\nhis back. he looked very out of place in his moleskin \\novercoat. \\n\\n“jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their \\ninterest at once. “an’ what’re you lot up ter?” he \\nlooked suddenly suspicious. “yer not still lookin’ fer \\nnicolas flamel, are yeh?” \\n\\n“oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said ron \\nimpressively. “and we know what that dog’s guarding, \\nit’s a sorcerer’s st — ” \\n\\n“shhhh\\\\” hagrid looked around quickly to see if \\nanyone was listening. “don’ go shoutin’ about it, \\nwhat’s the matter with yeh?” \\n\\n“there are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a \\nmatter of fact,” said harry, “about what’s guarding \\nthe stone apart from fluffy — ” \\n\\n“shhhh!” said hagrid again. “listen — come an’ see \\nme later, i’m not promisin’ i’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, \\nbut don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ \\ns’pposed ter know. they’ll think i’ve told yeh — ” \\n\\n“see you later, then,” said harry. \\n\\nhagrid shuffled off. \\n\\n“what was he hiding behind his back?” said \\nhermione thoughtfully. \\n\\n“do you think it had anything to do with the stone?” \\n\\n“i’m going to see what section he was in,” said ron, \\nwho’d had enough of working. he came back a \\nminute later with a pile of books in his arms and \\nslammed them down on the table. \\n\\npage | 258 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“dragons\\'.” he whispered. “hagrid was looking up stuff \\nabout dragons! look at these: dragon species of great \\nbritain and ireland; from egg to inferno, a dragon \\nkeeper’s guide.” \\n\\n“hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the \\nfirst time i ever met him,” said harry. \\n\\n“but it’s against our laws,” said ron. “dragon \\nbreeding was outlawed by the warlocks’ convention \\nof 1709, everyone knows that. it’s hard to stop \\nmuggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in \\nthe back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, \\nit’s dangerous. you should see the burns charlie’s got \\noff wild ones in romania.” \\n\\n“but there aren’t wild dragons in britain?” said harry. \\n\\n“of course there are,” said ron. “common welsh \\ngreen and hebridean blacks. the ministry of magic \\nhas a job hushing them up, i can tell you. our kind \\nhave to keep putting spells on muggles who’ve spotted \\nthem, to make them forget.” \\n\\n“so what on earth’s hagrid up to?” said hermione. \\n\\nwhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s \\nhut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all \\nthe curtains were closed. hagrid called “who is it?” \\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly \\nbehind them. \\n\\nit was stifling hot inside. even though it was such a \\nwarm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. \\n\\nhagrid made them tea and offered them stoat \\nsandwiches, which they refused. \\n\\n“so — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 259 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“yes,” said harry. there was no point beating around \\nthe bush. “we were wondering if you could tell us \\nwhat’s guarding the sorcerer’s stone apart from \\nfluffy.” \\n\\nhagrid frowned at him. \\n\\n“o’ course i can’t,” he said. “number one, i don’ know \\nmeself. number two, yeh know too much already, so i \\nwouldn’ tell yeh if i could. that stone’s here fer a good \\nreason. it was almost stolen outta gringotts — i \\ns’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? beats me how \\nyeh even know abou’ fluffy.” \\n\\n“oh, come on, hagrid, you might not want to tell us, \\nbut you do know, you know everything that goes on \\nround here,” said hermione in a warm, flattering \\nvoice. hagrid ’s beard twitched and they could tell he \\nwas smiling. “we only wondered who had done the \\nguarding, really.” hermione went on. “we wondered \\nwho dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, \\napart from you.” \\n\\nhagrid ’s chest swelled at these last words. harry and \\nron beamed at hermione. \\n\\n“well, i don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... \\nlet’s see ... he borrowed fluffy from me ... then some \\no’ the teachers did enchantments ... professor sprout \\n— professor flitwick — professor mcgonagall — ” he \\nticked them off on his fingers, “professor quirrell — \\nan’ dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. \\n\\nhang on, i’ve forgotten someone. oh yeah, professor \\nsnape.” \\n\\n“snape?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 260 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? look, \\nsnape helped protect the stone, he’s not about ter \\nsteal it.” \\n\\nharry knew ron and hermione were thinking the \\nsame as he was. if snape had been in on protecting \\nthe stone, it must have been easy to find out how the \\nother teachers had guarded it. he probably knew \\neverything — except, it seemed, quirrell’s spell and \\nhow to get past fluffy. \\n\\n“you’re the only one who knows how to get past \\nfluffy, aren’t you, hagrid?” said harry anxiously. \\n\\n“and you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? not even \\none of the teachers?” \\n\\n“not a soul knows except me an’ dumbledore,” said \\nhagrid proudly. \\n\\n“well, that’s something,” harry muttered to the \\nothers. “hagrid, can we have a window open? i’m \\nboiling.” \\n\\n“can’t, harry, sorry,” said hagrid. harry noticed him \\nglance at the fire. harry looked at it, too. \\n\\n“hagrid — what’s that?” \\n\\nbut he already knew what it was. in the very heart of \\nthe fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \\n\\n“ah,” said hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \\n“that’s — er ...” \\n\\n“where did you get it, hagrid?” said ron, crouching \\nover the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “it must’ve \\ncost you a fortune.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 261 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“won it,” said hagrid. “las’ night. i was down in the \\nvillage havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards \\nwith a stranger. think he was quite glad ter get rid of \\nit, ter be honest.” \\n\\n“but what are you going to do with it when it’s \\nhatched?” said hermione. \\n\\n“well, i’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said hagrid, pulling \\na large book from under his pillow. “got this outta the \\nlibrary — dragon breeding for pleasure and profit — \\nit’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. keep \\nthe egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on \\n’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ \\nbrandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. an’ \\nsee here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what i \\ngot there’s a norwegian ridge-back. they’re rare, \\nthem.” \\n\\nhe looked very pleased with himself, but hermione \\ndidn’t. \\n\\n“hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said. \\n\\nbut hagrid wasn’t listening. he was humming merrily \\nas he stoked the fire. \\n\\nso now they had something else to worry about: what \\nmight happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was \\nhiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \\n\\n“wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” ron \\nsighed, as evening after evening they struggled \\nthrough all the extra homework they were getting. \\nhermione had now started making study schedules \\nfor harry and ron, too. it was driving them nuts. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 262 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthen, one breakfast time, hedwig brought harry \\nanother note from hagrid. he had written only two \\nwords: it’s hatching. \\n\\nron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to \\nthe hut. hermione wouldn’t hear of it. \\n\\n“hermione, how many times in our lives are we going \\nto see a dragon hatching?” \\n\\n“we’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s \\nnothing to what hagrid ’s going to be in when someone \\nfinds out what he’s doing — ” \\n\\n“shut up!” harry whispered. \\n\\nmalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped \\ndead to listen. how much had he heard? harry didn’t \\nlike the look on malfoy’s face at all. \\n\\nron and hermione argued all the way to herbology \\nand in the end, hermione agreed to run down to \\nhagrid’s with the other two during morning break. \\nwhen the bell sounded from the castle at the end of \\ntheir lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels \\nat once and hurried through the grounds to the edge \\nof the forest. hagrid greeted them, looking flushed \\nand excited. \\n\\n“it’s nearly out.” he ushered them inside. \\n\\nthe egg was lying on the table. there were deep \\ncracks in it. something was moving inside; a funny \\nclicking noise was coming from it. \\n\\nthey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched \\nwith bated breath. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 263 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nall at once there was a scraping noise and the egg \\nsplit open. the baby dragon flopped onto the table. it \\nwasn’t exactly pretty; harry thought it looked like a \\ncrumpled, black umbrella. its spiny wings were huge \\ncompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout \\nwith wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, \\norange eyes. \\n\\nit sneezed. a couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \\n\\n“isn’t he beautiful?” hagrid murmured. he reached \\nout a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. it snapped at \\nhis fingers, showing pointed fangs. \\n\\n“bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said hagrid. \\n\\n“hagrid,” said hermione, “how fast do norwegian \\nridgebacks grow, exactly?” \\n\\nhagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly \\ndrained from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to \\nthe window. \\n\\n“what’s the matter?” \\n\\n“someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains \\n— it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.” \\n\\nharry bolted to the door and looked out. even at a \\ndistance there was no mistaking him. \\n\\nmalfoy had seen the dragon. \\n\\nsomething about the smile lurking on malfoy’s face \\nduring the next week made harry, ron, and hermione \\nvery nervous. they spent most of their free time in \\nhagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \\n\\n“just let him go,” harry urged. “set him free.” \\n\\npage | 264 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i can’t,” said hagrid. “he’s too little. he’d die.” \\n\\n\\n\\nthey looked at the dragon. it had grown three times \\nin length in just a week. smoke kept furling out of its \\nnostrils. hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping \\nduties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. \\nthere were empty brandy bottles and chicken \\nfeathers all over the floor. \\n\\n“i’ve decided to call him norbert,” said hagrid, looking \\nat the dragon with misty eyes. “he really knows me \\nnow, watch. norbert! norbert! where’s mommy?” \\n\\n“he’s lost his marbles,” ron muttered in harry’s ear. \\n\\n“hagrid,” said harry loudly, “give it two weeks and \\nnorbert’s going to be as long as your house. malfoy \\ncould go to dumbledore at any moment.” \\n\\nhagrid bit his lip. \\n\\n“i — i know i can’t keep him forever, but i can’t jus’ \\ndump him, can’t.” \\n\\nharry suddenly turned to ron. \\n\\n“charlie,” he said. \\n\\n“you’re losing it, too,” said ron. “i’m ron, remember?” \\n\\n“no — charlie — your brother, charlie. in romania. \\nstudying dragons. we could send norbert to him. \\ncharlie can take care of him and then put him back \\nin the wild!” \\n\\n“brilliant!” said ron. “how about it, hagrid?” \\n\\nand in the end, hagrid agreed that they could send \\nan owl to charlie to ask him. \\n\\npage | 265 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe following week dragged by. wednesday night \\nfound hermione and harry sitting alone in the \\ncommon room, long after everyone else had gone to \\nbed. the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight \\nwhen the portrait hole burst open. ron appeared out \\nof nowhere as he pulled off harry’s invisibility cloak. \\nhe had been down at hagrid’s hut, helping him feed \\nnorbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \\n\\n“it bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which \\nwas wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “i’m not going \\nto be able to hold a quill for a week. i tell you, that \\ndragon’s the most horrible animal i’ve ever met, but \\nthe way hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a \\nfluffy little bunny rabbit. when it bit me he told me off \\nfor frightening it. and when i left, he was singing it a \\nlullaby.” \\n\\nthere was a tap on the dark window. \\n\\n“it’s hedwig!” said harry, hurrying to let her in. “she’ll \\nhave charlie’s answer!” \\n\\nthe three of them put their heads together to read the \\nnote. \\n\\ndear ron, \\n\\nhow are you? thanks for the letter — i’d be glad to \\ntake the norwegian ridgeback, but it won’t be easy \\ngetting him here. i think the best thing will be to send \\nhim over with some friends of mine who are coming to \\nvisit me next week. trouble is, they mustn’t be seen \\ncarrying an illegal dragon. \\n\\ncould you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at \\nmidnight on saturday? they can meet you there and \\ntake him away while it’s still dark. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 266 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsend me an answer as soon as possible. \\n\\n\\n\\nlove, \\n\\ncharlie \\n\\nthey looked at one another. \\n\\n“we’ve got the invisibility cloak,” said harry. “it \\nshouldn’t be too difficult — i think the cloak’s big \\nenough to cover two of us and norbert.” \\n\\nit was a mark of how bad the last week had been that \\nthe other two agreed with him. anything to get rid of \\nnorbert — and malfoy. \\n\\nthere was a hitch. by the next morning, ron’s bitten \\nhand had swollen to twice its usual size. he didn’t \\nknow whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey — \\nwould she recognize a dragon bite? by the afternoon, \\nthough, he had no choice. the cut had turned a nasty \\nshade of green. it looked as if norbert’s fangs were \\npoisonous. \\n\\nharry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing \\nat the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in \\nbed. \\n\\n“it’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that \\nfeels like it’s about to fall off. malfoy told madam \\npomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he \\ncould come and have a good laugh at me. he kept \\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me — i’ve told \\nher it was a dog, but i don’t think she believes me — i \\nshouldn’t have hit him at the quidditch match, that’s \\nwhy he’s doing this.” \\n\\nharry and hermione tried to calm ron down. \\n\\npage | 267 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“it’ll all be over at midnight on saturday,” said \\nhermione, but this didn’t soothe ron at all. on the \\ncontrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \\n\\n“midnight on saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. \\n\\n“oh no — oh no — i’ve just remembered — charlie’s \\nletter was in that book malfoy took, he’s going to \\nknow we’re getting rid of norbert.” \\n\\nharry and hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. \\nmadam pomfrey came over at that moment and made \\nthem leave, saying ron needed sleep. \\n\\n“it’s too late to change the plan now,” harry told \\nhermione. “we haven’t got time to send charlie \\nanother owl, and this could be our only chance to get \\nrid of norbert. we’ll have to risk it. and we have got \\nthe invisibility cloak, malfoy doesn’t know about \\nthat.” \\n\\nthey found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a \\nbandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid, who \\nopened a window to talk to them. \\n\\n“i won’t let you in,” he puffed. “norbert’s at a tricky \\nstage — nothin’ i can’t handle.” \\n\\nwhen they told him about charlie’s letter, his eyes \\nfilled with tears, although that might have been \\nbecause norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \\n\\n“aargh! it’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ \\nplayin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.” \\n\\nthe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the \\nwindows rattle. harry and hermione walked back to \\nthe castle feeling saturday couldn’t come quickly \\nenough. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 268 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time \\ncame for him to say good-bye to norbert if they hadn’t \\nbeen so worried about what they had to do. it was a \\nvery dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late \\narriving at hagrid ’s hut because they’d had to wait for \\npeeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, \\nwhere he’d been playing tennis against the wall. \\n\\nhagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \\n\\n“he’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” \\nsaid hagrid in a muffled voice. “an’ i’ve packed his \\nteddy bear in case he gets lonely.” \\n\\nfrom inside the crate came ripping noises that \\nsounded to harry as though the teddy was having his \\nhead torn off. \\n\\n“bye-bye, norbert!” hagrid sobbed, as harry and \\nhermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak \\nand stepped underneath it themselves. “mommy will \\nnever forget you!” \\n\\nhow they managed to get the crate back up to the \\ncastle, they never knew. midnight ticked nearer as \\nthey heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the \\nentrance hall and along the dark corridors. up \\nanother staircase, then another — even one of harry’s \\nshortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. \\n\\n“nearly there!” harry panted as they reached the \\ncorridor beneath the tallest tower. \\n\\nthen a sudden movement ahead of them made them \\nalmost drop the crate. forgetting that they were \\nalready invisible, they shrank into the shadows, \\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling \\nwith each other ten feet away. a lamp flared. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 269 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprofessor mcgonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair \\nnet, had malfoy by the ear. \\n\\n\\n\\n“detention!” she shouted. “and twenty points from \\nslytherin! wandering around in the middle of the \\nnight, how dare you — ” \\n\\n“you don’t understand, professor. harry potter’s \\ncoming — he’s got a dragon!” \\n\\n“what utter rubbish! how dare you tell such lies! \\ncome on — i shall see professor snape about you, \\nmalfoy!” \\n\\nthe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower \\nseemed the easiest thing in the world after that. not \\nuntil they’d stepped out into the cold night air did \\nthey throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe \\nproperly again. hermione did a sort of jig. \\n\\n“malfoy’s got detention! i could sing!” \\n\\n“don’t,” harry advised her. \\n\\nchuckling about malfoy, they waited, norbert \\nthrashing about in his crate. about ten minutes later, \\nfour broomsticks came swooping down out of the \\ndarkness. \\n\\ncharlie’s friends were a cheery lot. they showed \\nharry and hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so \\nthey could suspend norbert between them. they all \\nhelped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry \\nand hermione shook hands with the others and \\nthanked them very much. \\n\\nat last, norbert was going ... going ... gone. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 270 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their \\nhearts as light as their hands, now that norbert was \\noff them. no more dragon — malfoy in detention — \\nwhat could spoil their happiness? \\n\\nthe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the \\nstairs. as they stepped into the corridor, filch’s face \\nloomed suddenly out of the darkness. \\n\\n“well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” \\n\\nthey’d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 271 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe forbidden forest \\n\\nthings couldn’t have been worse. \\n\\nfilch took them down to professor mcgonagall’s \\nstudy on the first floor, where they sat and waited \\nwithout saying a word to each other. hermione was \\ntrembling. excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \\nchased each other around harry’s brain, each more \\nfeeble than the last. he couldn’t see how they were \\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. they were \\ncornered. how could they have been so stupid as to \\nforget the cloak? there was no reason on earth that \\nprofessor mcgonagall would accept for their being out \\nof bed and creeping around the school in the dead of \\nnight, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, \\nwhich was out-of-bounds except for classes. add \\nnorbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as \\nwell be packing their bags already. \\n\\nhad harry thought that things couldn’t have been \\nworse? he was wrong. when professor mcgonagall \\nappeared, she was leading neville. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 272 \\n\\n\\n\\n“harry!” neville burst out, the moment he saw the \\nother two. “i was trying to find you to warn you, i \\nheard malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he \\nsaid you had a drag — ” \\n\\nharry shook his head violently to shut neville up, but \\nprofessor mcgonagall had seen. she looked more \\nlikely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over \\nthe three of them. \\n\\n“i would never have believed it of any of you. mr. filch \\nsays you were up in the astronomy tower. it’s one \\no’clock in the morning. explain yourselves.” \\n\\nit was the first time hermione had ever failed to \\nanswer a teacher’s question. she was staring at her \\nslippers, as still as a statue. \\n\\n“i think i’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” \\nsaid professor mcgonagall. “it doesn’t take a genius \\nto work it out. you fed draco malfoy some cock-and- \\nbull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed \\nand into trouble. i’ve already caught him. i suppose \\nyou think it’s funny that longbottom here heard the \\nstory and believed it, too?” \\n\\nharry caught neville’s eye and tried to tell him \\nwithout words that this wasn’t true, because neville \\nwas looking stunned and hurt. poor, blundering \\nneville — harry knew what it must have cost him to \\ntry and find them in the dark, to warn them. \\n\\n“i’m disgusted,” said professor mcgonagall. “four \\nstudents out of bed in one night! i’ve never heard of \\nsuch a thing before! you, miss granger, i thought you \\nhad more sense. as for you, mr. potter, i thought \\ngryffindor meant more to you than this. all three of \\nyou will receive detentions — yes, you too, mr. \\nlongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk \\npage | 273 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\naround school at night, especially these days, it’s very \\ndangerous — and fifty points will be taken from \\ngryffindor.” \\n\\n“fifty?” harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the \\nlead he’d won in the last quidditch match. \\n\\n“fifty points each,” said professor mcgonagall, \\nbreathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \\n\\n“professor — please — ” \\n\\n“you can’t—” \\n\\n“don’t tell me what i can and can’t do, potter. now get \\nback to bed, all of you. i’ve never been more ashamed \\nof gryffindor students.” \\n\\na hundred and fifty points lost. that put gryffindor in \\nlast place. in one night, they’d ruined any chance \\ngryffindor had had for the house cup. harry felt as \\nthough the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. \\nhow could they ever make up for this? \\n\\nharry didn’t sleep all night. he could hear neville \\nsobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. \\nharry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort \\nhim. he knew neville, like himself, was dreading the \\ndawn. what would happen when the rest of \\ngryffindor found out what they’d done? \\n\\nat first, gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses \\nthat recorded the house points the next day thought \\nthere ’d been a mistake. how could they suddenly \\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? \\nand then the story started to spread: harry potter, \\nthe famous harry potter, their hero of two quidditch \\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a \\ncouple of other stupid first years. \\n\\npage | 274 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom being one of the most popular and admired \\npeople at the school, harry was suddenly the most \\nhated. even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on \\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see \\nslytherin lose the house cup. everywhere harry \\nwent, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their \\nvoices as they insulted him. slytherins, on the other \\nhand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and \\ncheering, “thanks potter, we owe you one!” \\n\\nonly ron stood by him. \\n\\n“they’ll all forget this in a few weeks. fred and george \\nhave lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been \\nhere, and people still like them.” \\n\\n“they’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one \\ngo, though, have they?” said harry miserably. \\n\\n“well — no,” ron admitted. \\n\\nit was a bit late to repair the damage, but harry \\nswore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t \\nhis business from now on. he’d had it with sneaking \\naround and spying. he felt so ashamed of himself that \\nhe went to wood and offered to resign from the \\nquidditch team. \\n\\n“resign?” wood thundered. “what good’ll that do? \\n\\nhow are we going to get any points back if we can’t \\nwin at quidditch?” \\n\\nbut even quidditch had lost its fun. the rest of the \\nteam wouldn’t speak to harry during practice, and if \\nthey had to speak about him, they called him “the \\nseeker.” \\n\\nhermione and neville were suffering, too. they didn’t \\nhave as bad a time as harry, because they weren’t as \\n\\npage | 275 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. \\nhermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in \\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence. \\n\\nharry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far \\naway. all the studying he had to do kept his mind off \\nhis misery. he, ron, and hermione kept to \\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to \\nremember the ingredients in complicated potions, \\nlearn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates \\nof magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... \\n\\nthen, about a week before the exams were due to \\nstart, harry’s new resolution not to interfere in \\nanything that didn’t concern him was put to an \\nunexpected test. walking back from the library on his \\nown one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering \\nfrom a classroom up ahead. as he drew closer, he \\nheard quirrell’s voice. \\n\\n“no — no — not again, please — ” \\n\\nit sounded as though someone was threatening him. \\nharry moved closer. \\n\\n“all right — all right — ” he heard quirrell sob. \\n\\nnext second, quirrell came hurrying out of the \\nclassroom straightening his turban. he was pale and \\nlooked as though he was about to cry. he strode out \\nof sight; harry didn’t think quirrell had even noticed \\nhim. he waited until quirrell’s footsteps had \\ndisappeared, then peered into the classroom. it was \\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. harry \\nwas halfway toward it before he remembered what \\nhe’d promised himself about not meddling. \\n\\nall the same, he’d have gambled twelve sorcerer’s \\nstones that snape had just left the room, and from \\n\\npage | 276 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhat harry had just heard, snape would be walking \\nwith a new spring in his step — quirrell seemed to \\nhave given in at last. \\n\\nharry went back to the library, where hermione was \\ntesting ron on astronomy. harry told them what he’d \\nheard. \\n\\n“snape’s done it, then!” said ron. “if quirrell’s told \\nhim how to break his anti-dark force spell — ” \\n\\n“there’s still fluffy, though,” said hermione. \\n\\n“maybe snape’s found out how to get past him \\nwithout asking hagrid,” said ron, looking up at the \\nthousands of books surrounding them. “i bet there’s a \\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a \\ngiant three-headed dog. so what do we do, harry?” \\n\\nthe light of adventure was kindling again in ron’s \\neyes, but hermione answered before harry could. \\n\\n“go to dumbledore. that’s what we should have done \\nages ago. if we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown \\nout for sure.” \\n\\n“but we’ve got no proof.” said harry. “quirrell’s too \\nscared to back us up. snape’s only got to say he \\ndoesn’t know how the troll got in at halloween and \\nthat he was nowhere near the third floor — who do \\nyou think they’ll believe, him or us? it’s not exactly a \\nsecret we hate him, dumbledore ’ll think we made it \\nup to get him sacked. filch wouldn’t help us if his life \\ndepended on it, he’s too friendly with snape, and the \\nmore students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. \\nand don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about \\nthe stone or fluffy. that’ll take a lot of explaining.” \\n\\nhermione looked convinced, but ron didn’t. \\n\\npage | 277 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“if we just do a bit of poking around — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“no,” said harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking \\naround.” \\n\\nhe pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to \\nlearn the names of its moons. \\n\\nthe following morning, notes were delivered to harry, \\nhermione, and neville at the breakfast table. they \\nwere all the same: \\n\\nyour detention will take place at eleven o’clock \\ntonight. \\n\\nmeet mr. filch in the entrance hall. \\n\\nprofessor m. mcgonagall \\n\\nharry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in \\nthe furor over the points they’d lost. he half expected \\nhermione to complain that this was a whole night of \\nstudying lost, but she didn’t say a word. like harry, \\nshe felt they deserved what they’d got. \\n\\nat eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to ron \\nin the common room and went down to the entrance \\nhall with neville. filch was already there — and so \\nwas malfoy. harry had also forgotten that malfoy had \\ngotten a detention, too. \\n\\n“follow me,” said filch, lighting a lamp and leading \\nthem outside. \\n\\n“i bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule \\nagain, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “oh \\nyes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you \\nask me. ... it’s just a pity they let the old \\npunishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from \\npage | 278 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe ceiling for a few days, i’ve got the chains still in \\nmy office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever \\nneeded. ... right, off we go, and don’t think of running \\noff, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” \\n\\nthey marched off across the dark grounds. neville \\nkept sniffing. harry wondered what their punishment \\nwas going to be. it must be something really horrible, \\nor filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. \\n\\nthe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it \\nkept throwing them into darkness. ahead, harry \\ncould see the lighted windows of hagrid’s hut. then \\nthey heard a distant shout. \\n\\n“is that you, filch? hurry up, i want ter get started.” \\n\\nharry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working \\nwith hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. his relief must \\nhave showed in his face, because filch said, “i \\nsuppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with \\nthat oaf? well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest \\nyou’re going and i’m much mistaken if you’ll all come \\nout in one piece.” \\n\\nat this, neville let out a little moan, and malfoy \\nstopped dead in his tracks. \\n\\n“the forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite \\nas cool as usual. “we can’t go in there at night — \\nthere’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, i \\nheard.” \\n\\nneville clutched the sleeve of harry’s robe and made a \\nchoking noise. \\n\\n“that’s your problem, isn’t it?” said filch, his voice \\ncracking with glee. “should’ve thought of them \\nwerewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” \\n\\npage | 279 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, \\nfang at his heel. he was carrying his large crossbow, \\nand a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \\n\\n“abou’ time,” he said. “i bin waitin’ fer half an hour \\nalready. all right, harry, hermione?” \\n\\n“i shouldn’t be too friendly to them, hagrid,” said \\nfilch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.” \\n\\n“that’s why yer late, is it?” said hagrid, frowning at \\nfilch. “bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’snot your place ter do \\nthat. yeh’ve done yer bit, i’ll take over from here.” \\n\\n“i’ll be back at dawn,” said filch, “for what’s left of \\nthem,” he added nastily, and he turned and started \\nback toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the \\ndarkness. \\n\\nmalfoy now turned to hagrid. \\n\\n“i’m not going in that forest,” he said, and harry was \\npleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \\n\\n“yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts,” said \\nhagrid fiercely. “yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got \\nter pay fer it.” \\n\\n“but this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. i \\nthought we’d be copying lines or something, if my \\nfather knew i was doing this, he’d — ” \\n\\n“ — tell yer that’s how it is at hogwarts,” hagrid \\ngrowled. “copyin’ lines! what good’s that ter anyone? \\nyeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. if yeh think \\nyer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back \\noff ter the castle an’ pack. go on!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 280 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmalfoy didn’t move. he looked at hagrid furiously, but \\nthen dropped his gaze. \\n\\n“right then,” said hagrid, “now, listen carefully, \\n\\n’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ \\ni don’ want no one takin’ risks. follow me over here a \\nmoment.” \\n\\nhe led them to the very edge of the forest. holding his \\nlamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding \\nearth track that disappeared into the thick black \\ntrees. a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked \\ninto the forest. \\n\\n“look there,” said hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on \\nthe ground? silvery stuff? that’s unicorn blood. \\nthere’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. \\nthis is the second time in a week. i found one dead \\nlast wednesday. we’re gonna try an’ find the poor \\nthing. we might have ter put it out of its misery.” \\n\\n“and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us \\nfirst?” said malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his \\nvoice. \\n\\n“there’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh \\nif yer with me or fang,” said hagrid. “an’ keep ter the \\npath. right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties \\nan’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. there’s blood \\nall over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around \\nsince last night at least.” \\n\\n“i want fang,” said malfoy quickly, looking at fang’s \\nlong teeth. \\n\\n“all right, but i warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said hagrid. \\n“so me, harry, an’ hermione’ll go one way an’ draco, \\nneville, an’ fang’ll go the other. now, if any of us \\nfinds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? \\n\\npage | 281 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nget yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ \\nif anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll \\nall come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.” \\n\\nthe forest was black and silent. a little way into it \\nthey reached a fork in the earth path, and harry, \\nhermione, and hagrid took the left path while malfoy, \\nneville, and fang took the right. \\n\\nthey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. \\nevery now and then a ray of moonlight through the \\nbranches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the \\nfallen leaves. \\n\\nharry saw that hagrid looked very worried. \\n\\n“ could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” harry \\nasked. \\n\\n“not fast enough,” said hagrid. “it’s not easy ter catch \\na unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. i never \\nknew one ter be hurt before.” \\n\\nthey walked past a mossy tree stump. harry could \\nhear running water; there must be a stream \\nsomewhere close by. there were still spots of unicorn \\nblood here and there along the winding path. \\n\\n“you all right, hermione?” hagrid whispered. “don’ \\nworry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ \\nthen well be able ter — get behind that tree!” \\n\\nhagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them \\noff the path behind a towering oak. he pulled out an \\narrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready \\nto fire. the three of them listened. something was \\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a \\ncloak trailing along the ground. hagrid was squinting \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 282 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nup the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound \\nfaded away. \\n\\n“i knew it,” he murmured. “there’s summat in here \\nthat shouldn’ be.” \\n\\n“a werewolf?” harry suggested. \\n\\n“that wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, \\nneither,” said hagrid grimly. “right, follow me, but \\ncareful, now.” \\n\\nthey walked more slowly, ears straining for the \\nfaintest sound. suddenly, in a clearing ahead, \\nsomething definitely moved. \\n\\n“who’s there?” hagrid called. “show yerself — i’m \\narmed!” \\n\\nand into the clearing came — was it a man, or a \\nhorse? to the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, \\nbut below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body \\nwith a long, reddish tail. harry and hermione’s jaws \\ndropped. \\n\\n“oh, it’s you, ronan,” said hagrid in relief. “how are \\nyeh?” \\n\\nhe walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. \\n\\n“good evening to you, hagrid,” said ronan. he had a \\ndeep, sorrowful voice. “were you going to shoot me?” \\n\\n“can’t be too careful, ronan,” said hagrid, patting his \\ncrossbow. “there’s summat bad loose in this forest. \\nthis is harry potter an’ hermione granger, by the \\nway. students up at the school. an’ this is ronan, \\nyou two. he’s a centaur.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 283 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“we’d noticed,” said hermione faintly. \\n\\n\\n\\n“good evening,” said ronan. “students, are you? and \\ndo you learn much, up at the school?” \\n\\n“erm — ” \\n\\n“a bit,” said hermione timidly. \\n\\n“a bit. well, that’s something.” ronan sighed. he \\nflung back his head and stared at the sky. “mars is \\nbright tonight.” \\n\\n“yeah,” said hagrid, glancing up, too. “listen, i’m glad \\nwe’ve run inter yeh, ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn \\nbin hurt — you seen anythin’?” \\n\\nronan didn’t answer immediately. he stared \\nunblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \\n\\n“always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. \\n\\n“so it has been for ages past, so it is now.” \\n\\n“yeah,” said hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, \\nronan? anythin’ unusual?” \\n\\n“mars is bright tonight,” ronan repeated, while \\nhagrid watched him impatiently. “unusually bright.” \\n\\n“yeah, but i was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit \\nnearer home,” said hagrid. “so yeh haven’t noticed \\nanythin’ strange?” \\n\\nyet again, ronan took a while to answer. at last, he \\nsaid, “the forest hides many secrets.” \\n\\na movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid \\nraise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, \\n\\npage | 284 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nblack-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than \\nronan. \\n\\n\\n\\n“hullo, bane,” said hagrid. “all right?” \\n\\n“good evening, hagrid, i hope you are well?” \\n\\n“well enough. look, i’ve jus’ bin askin’ ronan, you \\nseen anythin’ odd in here lately? there’s a unicorn \\nbin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?” \\n\\nbane walked over to stand next to ronan. he looked \\nskyward. \\n\\n“mars is bright tonight,” he said simply. \\n\\n“we’ve heard,” said hagrid grumpily. “well, if either of \\nyou do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? we’ll be \\noff, then.” \\n\\nharry and hermione followed him out of the clearing, \\nstaring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until \\nthe trees blocked their view. \\n\\n“never,” said hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight \\nanswer out of a centaur. ruddy stargazers. not \\ninterested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.” \\n\\n“are there many of them in here?” asked hermione. \\n\\n“oh, a fair few. . . . keep themselves to themselves \\nmostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if \\never i want a word. they’re deep, mind, centaurs ... \\nthey know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” \\n\\n“d’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” \\nsaid harry. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 285 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“did that sound like hooves to you? nah, if yeh ask \\nme, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never \\nheard anythin’ like it before.” \\n\\nthey walked on through the dense, dark trees. harry \\nkept looking nervously over his shoulder. he had the \\nnasty feeling they were being watched. he was very \\nglad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them. \\nthey had just passed a bend in the path when \\nhermione grabbed hagrid ’s arm. \\n\\n“hagrid! look! red sparks, the others are in trouble!” \\n\\n“you two wait here!” hagrid shouted. “stay on the \\npath, i’ll come back for yeh!” \\n\\nthey heard him crashing away through the \\nundergrowth and stood looking at each other, very \\nscared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the \\nrustling of leaves around them. \\n\\n“you don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” \\nwhispered hermione. \\n\\n“i don’t care if malfoy has, but if something’s got \\nneville ... it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.” \\n\\nthe minutes dragged by. their ears seemed sharper \\nthan usual. harry’s seemed to be picking up every \\nsigh of the wind, every cracking twig. what was going \\non? where were the others? \\n\\nat last, a great crunching noise announced hagrid’s \\nreturn. malfoy, neville, and fang were with him. \\nhagrid was fuming. malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked \\nup behind neville and grabbed him as a joke. neville \\nhad panicked and sent up the sparks. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 286 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“well be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket \\nyou two were makin’. right, we’re changin’ groups — \\nneville, you stay with me an’ hermione, harry, you go \\nwith fang an’ this idiot. i’m sorry,” hagrid added in a \\nwhisper to harry, “but he’ll have a harder time \\nfrightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” \\n\\nso harry set off into the heart of the forest with \\nmalfoy and fang. they walked for nearly half an \\nhour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path \\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees \\nwere so thick. harry thought the blood seemed to be \\ngetting thicker. there were splashes on the roots of a \\ntree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing \\naround in pain close by. harry could see a clearing \\nahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient \\noak. \\n\\n“look — ” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop \\nmalfoy. \\n\\nsomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. \\nthey inched closer. \\n\\nit was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. harry \\nhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. its \\nlong, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where \\nit had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on \\nthe dark leaves. \\n\\nharry had taken one step toward it when a slithering \\nsound made him freeze where he stood. a bush on \\nthe edge of the clearing quivered. ... then, out of the \\nshadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the \\nground like some stalking beast. harry, malfoy, and \\nfang stood transfixed. the cloaked figure reached the \\nunicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the \\nanimals side, and began to drink its blood. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 287 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“aaaaaaaaaaargh ! ” \\n\\n\\n\\nmalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did \\nfang. the hooded figure raised its head and looked \\nright at harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its \\nfront. it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry \\n— he couldn’t move for fear. \\n\\nthen a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his \\nhead; it was as though his scar were on fire. half \\nblinded, he staggered backward. he heard hooves \\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean \\nover harry, charging at the figure. \\n\\nthe pain in harry’s head was so bad he fell to his \\nknees. it took a minute or two to pass. when he \\nlooked up, the figure had gone. a centaur was \\nstanding over him, not ronan or bane; this one \\nlooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a \\npalomino body. \\n\\n“are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling harry to \\nhis feet. \\n\\n“yes — thank you — what was that?” \\n\\nthe centaur didn’t answer. he had astonishingly blue \\neyes, like pale sapphires. he looked carefully at \\nharry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, \\nlivid, on harry’s forehead. \\n\\n“you are the potter boy,” he said. “you had better get \\nback to hagrid. the forest is not safe at this time — \\nespecially for you. can you ride? it will be quicker \\nthis way. \\n\\n“my name is firenze,” he added, as he lowered \\nhimself on to his front legs so that harry could \\nclamber onto his back. \\n\\npage | 288 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from \\nthe other side of the clearing. ronan and bane came \\nbursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and \\nsweaty. \\n\\n“firenze!” bane thundered. “what are you doing? you \\nhave a human on your back! have you no shame? are \\nyou a common mule?” \\n\\n“do you realize who this is?” said firenze. “this is the \\npotter boy. the quicker he leaves this forest, the \\nbetter.” \\n\\n“what have you been telling him?” growled bane. \\n“remember, firenze, we are sworn not to set \\nourselves against the heavens. have we not read what \\nis to come in the movements of the planets?” \\n\\nronan pawed the ground nervously. “i’m sure firenze \\nthought he was acting for the best,” he said in his \\ngloomy voice. \\n\\nbane kicked his back legs in anger. \\n\\n“for the best! what is that to do with us? centaurs \\nare concerned with what has been foretold! it is not \\nour business to run around like donkeys after stray \\nhumans in our forest!” \\n\\nfirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, \\nso that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \\n\\n“do you not see that unicorn?” firenze bellowed at \\nbane. “do you not understand why it was killed? or \\nhave the planets not let you in on that secret? i set \\nmyself against what is lurking in this forest, bane, \\nyes, with humans alongside me if i must.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 289 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand firenze whisked around; with harry clutching on \\nas best he could, they plunged off into the trees, \\nleaving ronan and bane behind them. \\n\\nharry didn’t have a clue what was going on. \\n\\n“why’s bane so angry?” he asked. “what was that \\nthing you saved me from, anyway?” \\n\\nfirenze slowed to a walk, warned harry to keep his \\nhead bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did \\nnot answer harry’s question. they made their way \\nthrough the trees in silence for so long that harry \\nthought firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. \\nthey were passing through a particularly dense patch \\nof trees, however, when firenze suddenly stopped. \\n\\n“harry potter, do you know what unicorn blood is \\nused for?” \\n\\n“no,” said harry, startled by the odd question. “we’ve \\nonly used the horn and tail hair in potions.” \\n\\n“that is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a \\nunicorn,” said firenze. “only one who has nothing to \\nlose, and everything to gain, would commit such a \\ncrime. the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even \\nif you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. \\nyou have slain something pure and defenseless to \\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a \\ncursed life, from the moment the blood touches your \\nlips.” \\n\\nharry stared at the back of firenze’s head, which was \\ndappled silver in the moonlight. \\n\\n“but who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “if \\nyou’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t \\nit?” \\n\\npage | 290 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“it is,” firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay \\nalive long enough to drink something else — \\nsomething that will bring you back to full strength \\nand power — something that will mean you can never \\ndie. mr. potter, do you know what is hidden in the \\nschool at this very moment?” \\n\\n“the sorcerer’s stone! of course — the elixir of life! \\nbut i don’t understand who — ” \\n\\n“can you think of nobody who has waited many years \\nto return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting \\ntheir chance?” \\n\\nit was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly \\naround harry’s heart. over the rustling of the trees, \\nhe seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told \\nhim on the night they had met: “some say he died. \\ncodswallop, in my opinion. dunno if he had enough \\nhuman left in him to die.” \\n\\n“do you mean,” harry croaked, “that was voz — ” \\n\\n“harry! harry, are you all right?” \\n\\nhermione was running toward them down the path, \\nhagrid puffing along behind her. \\n\\n“i’m fine,” said harry, hardly knowing what he was \\nsaying. “the unicorn’s dead, hagrid, it’s in that \\nclearing back there.” \\n\\n“this is where i leave you,” firenze murmured as \\nhagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “you are \\nsafe now.” \\n\\nharry slid off his back. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 291 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“good luck, harry potter,” said firenze. “the planets \\nhave been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. \\ni hope this is one of those times.” \\n\\nhe turned and cantered back into the depths of the \\nforest, leaving harry shivering behind him. \\n\\nron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, \\nwaiting for them to return. he shouted something \\nabout quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him \\nawake. in a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- \\neyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what \\nhad happened in the forest. \\n\\nharry couldn’t sit down. he paced up and down in \\nfront of the fire. he was still shaking. \\n\\n“snape wants the stone for voldemort ... and \\nvoldemort’s waiting in the forest ... and all this time \\nwe thought snape just wanted to get rich. ...” \\n\\n“stop saying the name!” said ron in a terrified \\nwhisper, as if he thought voldemort could hear them. \\n\\nharry wasn’t listening. \\n\\n“firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ... \\nbane was furious ... he was talking about interfering \\nwith what the planets say is going to happen. ... they \\nmust show that voldemort’s coming back. ... bane \\nthinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me. ... i \\nsuppose that’s written in the stars as well.” \\n\\n“will you stop saying the name\\\\” ron hissed. \\n\\n“so all i’ve got to wait for now is snape to steal the \\nstone,” harry went on feverishly, “then voldemort will \\nbe able to come and finish me off. ... well, i suppose \\nbane 11 be happy.” \\n\\npage | 292 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhermione looked very frightened, but she had a word \\nof comfort. \\n\\n“harry, everyone says dumbledore’s the only one \\nyou-know-who was ever afraid of. with dumbledore \\naround, you-know-who won’t touch you. anyway, \\nwho says the centaurs are right? it sounds like \\nfortune-telling to me, and professor mcgonagall says \\nthat’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” \\n\\nthe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. \\nthey went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. but \\nthe night’s surprises weren’t over. \\n\\nwhen harry pulled back his sheets, he found his \\ninvisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. \\nthere was a note pinned to it: \\n\\njust in case. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 293 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthrough the trapdoor \\n\\nin years to come, harry would never quite remember \\nhow he had managed to get through his exams when \\nhe half expected voldemort to come bursting through \\nthe door at any moment. yet the days crept by, and \\nthere could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and \\nwell behind the locked door. \\n\\nit was sweltering hot, especially in the large \\nclassroom where they did their written papers. they \\nhad been given special, new quills for the exams, \\nwhich had been bewitched with an anti-cheating \\nspell. \\n\\nthey had practical exams as well. professor flitwick \\ncalled them one by one into his class to see if they \\ncould make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. \\nprofessor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse \\ninto a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the \\nsnuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. \\nsnape made them all nervous, breathing down their \\nnecks while they tried to remember how to make a \\nforgetfulness potion. \\n\\npage | 294 \\n\\n\\n\\nharry did the best he could, trying to ignore the \\nstabbing pains in his forehead, which had been \\nbothering him ever since his trip into the forest. \\nneville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves \\nbecause harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that \\nharry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except \\nthat it was now worse than ever because there was a \\nhooded figure dripping blood in it. \\n\\nmaybe it was because they hadn’t seen what harry \\nhad seen in the forest, or because they didn’t have \\nscars burning on their foreheads, but ron and \\nhermione didn’t seem as worried about the stone as \\nharry. the idea of voldemort certainly scared them, \\nbut he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they \\nwere so busy with their studying they didn’t have \\nmuch time to fret about what snape or anyone else \\nmight be up to. \\n\\ntheir very last exam was history of magic. one hour \\nof answering questions about batty old wizards who’d \\ninvented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, \\nfree for a whole wonderful week until their exam \\nresults came out. when the ghost of professor binns \\ntold them to put down their quills and roll up their \\nparchment, harry couldn’t help cheering with the \\nrest. \\n\\n“that was far easier than i thought it would be,” said \\nhermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto \\nthe sunny grounds. “i needn’t have learned about the \\n1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of \\nelfric the eager.” \\n\\nhermione always liked to go through their exam \\npapers afterward, but ron said this made him feel ill, \\nso they wandered down to the lake and flopped under \\na tree. the weasley twins and lee jordan were \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 295 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was \\nbasking in the warm shallows. \\n\\n\\n\\n“no more studying,” ron sighed happily, stretching \\nout on the grass. “you could look more cheerful, \\n\\nharry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly \\nwe’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” \\n\\nharry was rubbing his forehead. \\n\\n“i wish i knew what this means\\\\” he burst out angrily. \\n“my scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but \\nnever as often as this.” \\n\\n“go to madam pomfrey,” hermione suggested. \\n\\n“i’m not ill,” said harry. “i think it’s a warning ... it \\nmeans danger’s coming. ...” \\n\\nron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. \\n\\n“harry, relax, hermione ’s right, the stone’s safe as \\nlong as dumbledore’s around. anyway, we’ve never \\nhad any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy. \\nhe nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to \\ntry it again in a hurry. and neville will play quidditch \\nfor england before hagrid lets dumbledore down.” \\n\\nharry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking \\nfeeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, \\nsomething important. when he tried to explain this, \\nhermione said, “that’s just the exams. i woke up last \\nnight and was halfway through my transfiguration \\nnotes before i remembered we’d done that one.” \\n\\nharry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have \\nanything to do with work, though. he watched an owl \\nflutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a \\nnote clamped in its mouth. hagrid was the only one \\n\\npage | 296 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwho ever sent him letters. hagrid would never betray \\ndumbledore. hagrid would never tell anyone how to \\nget past fluffy . . . never . . . but — \\n\\nharry suddenly jumped to his feet. \\n\\n“where ’re you going?” said ron sleepily. \\n\\n“i’ve just thought of something,” said harry. he had \\nturned white. “we’ve got to go and see hagrid, now.” \\n\\n“why?” panted hermione, hurrying to keep up. \\n\\n“don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said harry, \\nscrambling up the grassy slope, “that what hagrid \\nwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a \\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in \\nhis pocket? how many people wander around with \\ndragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? lucky they \\nfound hagrid, don’t you think? why didn’t i see it \\nbefore?” \\n\\n“what are you talking about?” said ron, but harry, \\nsprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t \\nanswer. \\n\\nhagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; \\nhis trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was \\nshelling peas into a large bowl. \\n\\n“hullo,” he said, smiling. “finished yer exams? got \\ntime fer a drink?” \\n\\n“yes, please,” said ron, but harry cut him off. \\n\\n“no, we’re in a hurry. hagrid, i’ve got to ask you \\nsomething. you know that night you won norbert? \\nwhat did the stranger you were playing cards with \\nlook like?” \\n\\npage | 297 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“dunno said hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his \\ncloak off.” \\n\\n\\n\\nhe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his \\neyebrows. \\n\\n“it’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in \\nthe hog’s head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the \\nvillage. mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? i \\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.” \\n\\nharry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\n\\n“what did you talk to him about, hagrid? did you \\nmention hogwarts at all?” \\n\\n“mighta come up,” said hagrid, frowning as he tried \\nto remember. “yeah ... he asked what i did, an’ i told \\nhim i was gamekeeper here. ... he asked a bit about \\nthe sorta creatures i look after ... so i told him ... an’ i \\nsaid what i’d always really wanted was a dragon ... \\nan’ then ... i can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept \\nbuyin’ me drinks. ... let’s see ... yeah, then he said he \\nhad the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if i \\nwanted . . . but he had ter be sure i could handle it, he \\ndidn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... so i told him, \\nafter fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” \\n\\n“and did he — did he seem interested in fluffy?” \\n\\nharry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \\n\\n“well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh \\nmeet, even around hogwarts? so i told him, fluffy’s a \\npiece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ \\nplay him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter \\nsleep — ” \\n\\nhagrid suddenly looked horrified. \\n\\npage | 298 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “forget i \\nsaid it! hey — where’re yeh goin’?” \\n\\nharry, ron, and hermione didn’t speak to each other \\nat all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, \\nwhich seemed very cold and gloomy after the \\ngrounds. \\n\\n“we’ve got to go to dumbledore,” said harry. “hagrid \\ntold that stranger how to get past fluffy, and it was \\neither snape or voldemort under that cloak — it \\nmust’ve been easy, once he’d got hagrid drunk. i just \\nhope dumbledore believes us. firenze might back us \\nup if bane doesn’t stop him. where’s dumbledore’s \\noffice?” \\n\\nthey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign \\npointing them in the right direction. they had never \\nbeen told where dumbledore lived, nor did they know \\nanyone who had been sent to see him. \\n\\n“well just have to — ” harry began, but a voice \\nsuddenly rang across the hall. \\n\\n“what are you three doing inside?” \\n\\nit was professor mcgonagall, carrying a large pile of \\nbooks. \\n\\n“we want to see professor dumbledore,” said \\nhermione, rather bravely, harry and ron thought. \\n\\n“see professor dumbledore?” professor mcgonagall \\nrepeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to \\nwant to do. “why?” \\n\\nharry swallowed — now what? \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 299 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“it’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he \\nhadn’t, because professor mcgonagall’s nostrils \\nflared. \\n\\n“professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said \\ncoldly. “he received an urgent owl from the ministry \\nof magic and flew off for london at once.” \\n\\n“he’s gone?” said harry frantically. “now?” \\n\\n“professor dumbledore is a very great wizard, potter, \\nhe has many demands on his time — ” \\n\\n“but this is important.” \\n\\n“something you have to say is more important than \\nthe ministry of magic, potter?” \\n\\n“look,” said harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\n“professor — it’s about the sorcerer’s stone — ” \\n\\nwhatever professor mcgonagall had expected, it \\nwasn’t that. the books she was carrying tumbled out \\nof her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. \\n\\n“how do you know — ?” she spluttered. \\n\\n“professor, i think — i know — that sn — that \\nsomeone’s going to try and steal the stone. i’ve got to \\ntalk to professor dumbledore.” \\n\\nshe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \\n\\n“professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she \\nsaid finally. “i don’t know how you found out about \\nthe stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal \\nit, it’s too well protected.” \\n\\n“but professor — ” \\n\\npage | 300 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“potter, i know what i’m talking about,” she said \\nshortly. she bent down and gathered up the fallen \\nbooks. “i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy \\nthe sunshine.” \\n\\nbut they didn’t. \\n\\n“it’s tonight,” said harry, once he was sure professor \\nmcgonagall was out of earshot. “snape’s going \\nthrough the trapdoor tonight. he’s found out \\neverything he needs, and now he’s got dumbledore \\nout of the way. he sent that note, i bet the ministry of \\nmagic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns \\nup.” \\n\\n“but what can we — ” \\n\\nhermione gasped. harry and ron wheeled round. \\nsnape was standing there. \\n\\n“good afternoon,” he said smoothly. \\n\\nthey stared at him. \\n\\n“you shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, \\nwith an odd, twisted smile. \\n\\n“we were — ” harry began, without any idea what he \\nwas going to say. \\n\\n“you want to be more careful,” said snape. “hanging \\naround like this, people will think you’re up to \\nsomething. and gryffindor really can’t afford to lose \\nany more points, can it?” \\n\\nharry flushed. they turned to go outside, but snape \\ncalled them back. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 301 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“be warned, potter — any more nighttime wanderings \\nand i will personally make sure you are expelled. \\n\\ngood day to you.” \\n\\nhe strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \\n\\nout on the stone steps, harry turned to the others. \\n\\n“right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered \\nurgently. “one of us has got to keep an eye on snape \\n— wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he \\nleaves it. hermione, you’d better do that.” \\n\\n“why me?” \\n\\n“it’s obvious,” said ron. “you can pretend to be \\nwaiting for professor flitwick, you know.” he put on a \\nhigh voice, “ ‘oh professor flitwick, i’m so worried, i \\nthink i got question fourteen b wrong. . . . ’ ” \\n\\n“oh, shut up,” said hermione, but she agreed to go \\nand watch out for snape. \\n\\n“and we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” \\nharry told ron. “come on.” \\n\\nbut that part of the plan didn’t work. no sooner had \\nthey reached the door separating fluffy from the rest \\nof the school than professor mcgonagall turned up \\nagain and this time, she lost her temper. \\n\\n“i suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a \\npack of enchantments!” she stormed. “enough of this \\nnonsense! if i hear you’ve come anywhere near here \\nagain, i’ll take another fifty points from gryffindor! \\n\\nyes, weasley, from my own house!” \\n\\nharry and ron went back to the common room. harry \\nhad just said, “at least hermione’s on snape’s tail,” \\n\\npage | 302 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the portrait of the fat lady swung open and \\nhermione came in. \\n\\n“i’m sorry, harry!” she wailed. “snape came out and \\nasked me what i was doing, so i said i was waiting for \\nflitwick, and snape went to get him, and i’ve only \\njust got away, i don’t know where snape went.” \\n\\n“well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” harry said. \\n\\nthe other two stared at him. he was pale and his eyes \\nwere glittering. \\n\\n“i’m going out of here tonight and i’m going to try and \\nget to the stone first.” \\n\\n“you’re mad!” said ron. \\n\\n“you can’t!” said hermione. “after what mcgonagall \\nand snape have said? you’ll be expelled!” \\n\\n“so what?” harry shouted. “don’t you understand? \\nif snape gets hold of the stone, voldemort’s coming \\nback! haven’t you heard what it was like when he was \\ntrying to take over? there won’t be any hogwarts to \\nget expelled from! he’ll flatten it, or turn it into a \\nschool for the dark arts! losing points doesn’t matter \\nanymore, can’t you see? d’you think he’ll leave you \\nand your families alone if gryffindor wins the house \\ncup? if i get caught before i can get to the stone, well, \\ni’ll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for \\nvoldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later \\nthan i would have, because i’m never going over to \\nthe dark side! i’m going through that trapdoor \\ntonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! \\nvoldemort killed my parents, remember?” \\n\\nhe glared at them. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 303 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you’re right, harry,” said hermione in a small voice. \\n\\n\\n\\n“i’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said harry. “it’s just \\nlucky i got it back.” \\n\\n“but will it cover all three of us?” said ron. \\n\\n“all — all three of us?” \\n\\n“oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go \\nalone?” \\n\\n“of course not,” said hermione briskly. “how do you \\nthink you’d get to the stone without us? i’d better go \\nand look through my books, there might be \\nsomething useful. ...” \\n\\n“but if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” \\n\\n“not if i can help it,” said hermione grimly. “flitwick \\ntold me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve \\npercent on his exam. they’re not throwing me out \\nafter that.” \\n\\nafter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in \\nthe common room. nobody bothered them; none of \\nthe gryffindors had anything to say to harry any \\nmore, after all. this was the first night he hadn’t been \\nupset by it. hermione was skimming through all her \\nnotes, hoping to come across one of the \\nenchantments they were about to try to break. harry \\nand ron didn’t talk much. both of them were \\nthinking about what they were about to do. \\n\\nslowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \\n\\n“better get the cloak,” ron muttered, as lee jordan \\nfinally left, stretching and yawning. harry ran \\nupstairs to their dark dormitory. he pulled out the \\n\\npage | 304 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had \\ngiven him for christmas. he pocketed it to use on \\nfluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing. \\n\\nhe ran back down to the common room. \\n\\n“we’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it \\ncovers all three of us — if filch spots one of our feet \\nwandering along on its own — ” \\n\\n“what are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of \\nthe room. neville appeared from behind an armchair, \\nclutching trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d \\nbeen making another bid for freedom. \\n\\n“nothing, neville, nothing,” said harry, hurriedly \\nputting the cloak behind his back. \\n\\nneville stared at their guilty faces. \\n\\n“you’re going out again,” he said. \\n\\n“no, no, no,” said hermione. “no, we’re not. why don’t \\nyou go to bed, neville?” \\n\\nharry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. \\nthey couldn’t afford to waste any more time, snape \\nmight even now be playing fluffy to sleep. \\n\\n“you can’t go out,” said neville, “you’ll be caught \\nagain. gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” \\n\\n“you don’t understand,” said harry, “this is \\nimportant.” \\n\\nbut neville was clearly steeling himself to do \\nsomething desperate. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 305 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“i won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in \\nfront of the portrait hole. “i’ll — i’ll fight you!” \\n\\n“neville,” ron exploded, “get away from that hole and \\ndon’t be an idiot — ” \\n\\n“don’t you call me an idiot!” said neville. “i don’t \\nthink you should be breaking any more rules! and \\nyou were the one who told me to stand up to people!” \\n\\n“yes, but not to us,” said ron in exasperation. \\n\\n“neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” \\n\\nhe took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the \\ntoad, who leapt out of sight. \\n\\n“go on then, try and hit me!” said neville, raising his \\nfists. “i’m ready!” \\n\\nharry turned to hermione. \\n\\n“do something,” he said desperately. \\n\\nhermione stepped forward. \\n\\n“neville,” she said, “i’m really, really sorry about this.” \\nshe raised her wand. \\n\\n“petrificus totalusl” she cried, pointing it at neville. \\n\\nneville’s arms snapped to his sides. his legs sprang \\ntogether. his whole body rigid, he swayed where he \\nstood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. \\n\\nhermione ran to turn him over. neville’s jaws were \\njammed together so he couldn’t speak. only his eyes \\nwere moving, looking at them in horror. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 306 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“what’ve you done to him?” harry whispered. \\n\\n\\n\\n“it’s the full body-bind,” said hermione miserably. \\n“oh, neville, i’m so sorry.” \\n\\n“we had to, neville, no time to explain,” said harry. \\n\\n“you’ll understand later, neville,” said ron as they \\nstepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. \\n\\nbut leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t \\nfeel like a very good omen. in their nervous state, \\nevery statue’s shadow looked like filch, every distant \\nbreath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on \\nthem. \\n\\nat the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted mrs. \\nnorris skulking near the top. \\n\\n“oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” ron whispered in \\nharry’s ear, but harry shook his head. as they \\nclimbed carefully around her, mrs. norris turned her \\nlamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. \\n\\nthey didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the \\nstaircase up to the third floor. peeves was bobbing \\nhalfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would \\ntrip. \\n\\n“who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed \\ntoward him. he narrowed his wicked black eyes. \\n“know you’re there, even if i can’t see you. are you \\nghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” \\n\\nhe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at \\nthem. \\n\\n“should call filch, i should, if something’s a-creeping \\naround unseen.” \\n\\npage | 307 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry had a sudden idea. \\n\\n\\n\\n“peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the bloody \\nbaron has his own reasons for being invisible.” \\n\\npeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. he caught \\nhimself in time and hovered about a foot off the \\nstairs. \\n\\n“so sorry, your bloodiness, mr. baron, sir,” he said \\ngreasily. “my mistake, my mistake — i didn’t see you \\n— of course i didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old \\npeevsie his little joke, sir.” \\n\\n“i have business here, peeves,” croaked harry. “stay \\naway from this place tonight.” \\n\\n“i will, sir, i most certainly will,” said peeves, rising up \\nin the air again. “hope your business goes well, \\n\\nbaron, i’ll not bother you.” \\n\\nand he scooted off. \\n\\n“brilliant, harry!” whispered ron. \\n\\na few seconds later, they were there, outside the \\nthird-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. \\n\\n“well, there you are,” harry said quietly, “snape’s \\nalready got past fluffy.” \\n\\nseeing the open door somehow seemed to impress \\nupon all three of them what was facing them. \\nunderneath the cloak, harry turned to the other two. \\n\\n“if you want to go back, i won’t blame you,” he said. \\n“you can take the cloak, i won’t need it now.” \\n\\n“don’t be stupid,” said ron. \\n\\npage | 308 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“we’re coming,” said hermione. \\n\\nharry pushed the door open. \\n\\nas the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their \\nears. all three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their \\ndirection, even though it couldn’t see them. \\n\\n“what’s that at its feet?” hermione whispered. \\n\\n“looks like a harp,” said ron. “snape must have left it \\nthere.” \\n\\n“it must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said \\nharry. “well, here goes ...” \\n\\nhe put hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. it wasn’t \\nreally a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes \\nbegan to droop. harry hardly drew breath. slowly, the \\ndog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell \\nto its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast \\nasleep. \\n\\n“keep playing,” ron warned harry as they slipped out \\nof the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. they \\ncould feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they \\napproached the giant heads. \\n\\n“i think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said ron, \\npeering over the dog’s back. “want to go first, \\nhermione?” \\n\\n“no, i don’t!” \\n\\n“all right.” ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully \\nover the dog’s legs. he bent and pulled the ring of the \\ntrapdoor, which swung up and open. \\n\\n“what can you see?” hermione said anxiously. \\n\\npage | 309 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing \\ndown, we’ll just have to drop.” \\n\\nharry, who was still playing the flute, waved at ron to \\nget his attention and pointed at himself. \\n\\n“you want to go first? are you sure?” said ron. “i \\ndon’t know how deep this thing goes. give the flute to \\nhermione so she can keep him asleep.” \\n\\nharry handed the flute over. in the few seconds’ \\nsilence, the dog growled and twitched, but the \\nmoment hermione began to play, it fell back into its \\ndeep sleep. \\n\\nharry climbed over it and looked down through the \\ntrapdoor. there was no sign of the bottom. \\n\\nhe lowered himself through the hole until he was \\nhanging on by his fingertips. then he looked up at \\nron and said, “if anything happens to me, don’t \\nfollow. go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to \\ndumbledore, right?” \\n\\n“right,” said ron. \\n\\n“see you in a minute, i hope. ...” \\n\\nand harry let go. cold, damp air rushed past him as \\nhe fell down, down, down and — \\n\\nflump. with a funny, muffled sort of thump he \\nlanded on something soft. he sat up and felt around, \\nhis eyes not used to the gloom. it felt as though he \\nwas sitting on some sort of plant. \\n\\n“it’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a \\npostage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a \\nsoft landing, you can jump!” \\n\\npage | 310 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nron followed right away. he landed, sprawled next to \\nharry. \\n\\n“what’s this stuff?” were his first words. \\n\\n“dunno, some sort of plant thing. i suppose it’s here \\nto break the fall. come on, hermione!” \\n\\nthe distant music stopped. there was a loud bark \\nfrom the dog, but hermione had already jumped. she \\nlanded on harry’s other side. \\n\\n“we must be miles under the school,” she said. \\n\\n“lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said ron. \\n\\n“lucky\\\\” shrieked hermione. “look at you both!” \\n\\nshe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. she \\nhad to struggle because the moment she had landed, \\nthe plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils \\naround her ankles. as for harry and ron, their legs \\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers \\nwithout their noticing. \\n\\nhermione had managed to free herself before the \\nplant got a firm grip on her. now she watched in \\nhorror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off \\nthem, but the more they strained against it, the \\ntighter and faster the plant wound around them. \\n\\n“stop moving!” hermione ordered them. “i know what \\nthis is — it’s devil’s snare!” \\n\\n“oh, i’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a \\ngreat help,” snarled ron, leaning back, trying to stop \\nthe plant from curling around his neck. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 311 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“shut up, i’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said \\nhermione. \\n\\n“well, hurry up, i can’t breathe!” harry gasped, \\nwrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \\n\\n“devil’s snare, devil’s snare ... what did professor \\nsprout say? — it likes the dark and the damp — ” \\n\\n“so light a fire!” harry choked. \\n\\n“yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” hermione \\ncried, wringing her hands. \\n\\n“have you gone mad?” ron bellowed. “are you a \\nwitch or not?” \\n\\n“oh, right!” said hermione, and she whipped out her \\nwand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of \\nthe same bluebell flames she had used on snape at \\nthe plant. in a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it \\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light \\nand warmth. wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself \\nfrom their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \\n\\n“lucky you pay attention in herbology, hermione,” \\nsaid harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat \\noff his face. \\n\\n“yeah,” said ron, “and lucky harry doesn’t lose his \\nhead in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” \\n\\n“this way,” said harry, pointing down a stone \\npassageway, which was the only way forward. \\n\\nall they could hear apart from their footsteps was the \\ngentle drip of water trickling down the walls. the \\npassageway sloped downward, and harry was \\nreminded of gringotts. with an unpleasant jolt of the \\n\\npage | 312 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be \\nguarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. if they met a \\ndragon, a fully-grown dragon — norbert had been bad \\nenough ... \\n\\n“can you hear something?” ron whispered. \\n\\nharry listened. a soft rustling and clinking seemed to \\nbe coming from up ahead. \\n\\n“do you think it’s a ghost?” \\n\\n“i don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.” \\n\\n“there’s light ahead — i can see something moving.” \\n\\nthey reached the end of the passageway and saw \\nbefore them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling \\narching high above them. it was full of small, jewel- \\nbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the \\nroom. on the opposite side of the chamber was a \\nheavy wooden door. \\n\\n“do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” \\nsaid ron. \\n\\n“probably,” said harry. “they don’t look very vicious, \\nbut i suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . \\nwell, there’s no other choice ... i’ll run.” \\n\\nhe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, \\nand sprinted across the room. he expected to feel \\nsharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, \\nbut nothing happened. he reached the door \\nuntouched. he pulled the handle, but it was locked. \\n\\nthe other two followed him. they tugged and heaved \\nat the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when \\nhermione tried her alohomora charm. \\n\\npage | 313 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“now what?” said ron. \\n\\n\\n\\n“these birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” \\nsaid hermione. \\n\\nthey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — \\nglittering? \\n\\n“they’re not birds!” harry said suddenly. “they’re \\nkeys\\\\ winged keys — look carefully. so that must \\nmean ...” he looked around the chamber while the \\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes — \\nlook! broomsticks! we’ve got to catch the key to the \\ndoor!” \\n\\n“but there are hundreds of them!” \\n\\nron examined the lock on the door. \\n\\n“we’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably \\nsilver, like the handle.” \\n\\nthey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the \\nair, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. they \\ngrabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted \\nand dived so quickly it was almost impossible to \\ncatch one. \\n\\nnot for nothing, though, was harry the youngest \\nseeker in a century. he had a knack for spotting \\nthings other people didn’t. after a minute’s weaving \\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he \\nnoticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it \\nhad already been caught and stuffed roughly into the \\nkeyhole. \\n\\n“that one!” he called to the others. “that big one — \\nthere — no, there — with bright blue wings — the \\nfeathers are all crumpled on one side.” \\n\\npage | 314 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nron went speeding in the direction that harry was \\npointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off \\nhis broom. \\n\\n“we’ve got to close in on it!” harry called, not taking \\nhis eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “ron, you \\ncome at it from above — hermione, stay below and \\nstop it from going down — and i’ll try and catch it. \\nright, now!” \\n\\nron dived, hermione rocketed upward, the key \\ndodged them both, and harry streaked after it; it sped \\ntoward the wall, harry leaned forward and with a \\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone \\nwith one hand. ron and hermione ’s cheers echoed \\naround the high chamber. \\n\\nthey landed quickly, and harry ran to the door, the \\nkey struggling in his hand. he rammed it into the lock \\nand turned — it worked. the moment the lock had \\nclicked open, the key took flight again, looking very \\nbattered now that it had been caught twice. \\n\\n“ready?” harry asked the other two, his hand on the \\ndoor handle. they nodded. he pulled the door open. \\n\\nthe next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see \\nanything at all. but as they stepped into it, light \\nsuddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing \\nsight. \\n\\nthey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, \\nbehind the black chessmen, which were all taller than \\nthey were and carved from what looked like black \\nstone. facing them, way across the chamber, were \\nthe white pieces. harry, ron and hermione shivered \\nslightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. \\n\\n“now what do we do?” harry whispered. \\n\\npage | 315 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“it’s obvious, isn’t it?” said ron. “we’ve got to play our \\nway across the room.” \\n\\n\\n\\nbehind the white pieces they could see another door. \\n\\n“how?” said hermione nervously. \\n\\n“i think,” said ron, “we’re going to have to be \\nchessmen.” \\n\\nhe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out \\nto touch the knights horse. at once, the stone sprang \\nto life. the horse pawed the ground and the knight \\nturned his helmeted head to look down at ron. \\n\\n“do we — er — have to join you to get across?” \\n\\nthe black knight nodded. ron turned to the other \\ntwo. \\n\\n“this needs thinking about. ...” he said. “i suppose \\nwe’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. \\n\\n\\n\\nharry and hermione stayed quiet, watching ron \\nthink. finally he said, “now, don’t be offended or \\nanything, but neither of you are that good at chess — \\n\\n\\n\\n“we’re not offended,” said harry quickly. “just tell us \\nwhat to do.” \\n\\n“well, harry, you take the place of that bishop, and \\nhermione, you go there instead of that castle.” \\n\\n“what about you?” \\n\\n“i’m going to be a knight,” said ron. \\n\\npage | 316 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because \\nat these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned \\ntheir backs on the white pieces and walked off the \\nboard, leaving three empty squares that harry, ron, \\nand hermione took. \\n\\n“white always plays first in chess,” said ron, peering \\nacross the board. “yes ... look ...” \\n\\na white pawn had moved forward two squares. \\n\\nron started to direct the black pieces. they moved \\nsilently wherever he sent them. harry’s knees were \\ntrembling. what if they lost? \\n\\n“harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.” \\n\\ntheir first real shock came when their other knight \\nwas taken. the white queen smashed him to the floor \\nand dragged him off the board, where he lay quite \\nstill, facedown. \\n\\n“had to let that happen,” said ron, looking shaken. \\n“leaves you free to take that bishop, hermione, go \\non.” \\n\\nevery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces \\nshowed no mercy. soon there was a huddle of limp \\nblack players slumped along the wall. twice, ron only \\njust noticed in time that harry and hermione were in \\ndanger. he himself darted around the board, taking \\nalmost as many white pieces as they had lost black \\nones. \\n\\n“we’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “let me \\nthink — let me think ...” \\n\\nthe white queen turned her blank face toward him. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 317 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“yes ...” said ron softly, “it’s the only way ... i’ve got \\nto be taken.” \\n\\n\\n\\n“no!” harry and hermione shouted. \\n\\n“that’s chess!” snapped ron. “you’ve got to make \\nsome sacrifices! i make my move and she’ll take me — \\nthat leaves you free to checkmate the king, harry!” \\n\\n“but — ” \\n\\n“do you want to stop snape or not?” \\n\\n“ron — ” \\n\\n“look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the \\nstone!” \\n\\nthere was no alternative. \\n\\n“ready?” ron called, his face pale but determined. \\n“here i go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve \\nwon.” \\n\\nhe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. \\nshe struck ron hard across the head with her stone \\narm, and he crashed to the floor — hermione \\nscreamed but stayed on her square — the white \\nqueen dragged ron to one side. he looked as if he’d \\nbeen knocked out. \\n\\nshaking, harry moved three spaces to the left. \\n\\nthe white king took off his crown and threw it at \\nharry’s feet. they had won. the chessmen parted and \\nbowed, leaving the door ahead clear. with one last \\ndesperate look back at ron, harry and hermione \\ncharged through the door and up the next \\npassageway. \\n\\npage | 318 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“what if he’s — ?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“he’ll be all right,” said harry, trying to convince \\nhimself. “what do you reckon’s next?” \\n\\n“we’ve had sprout’s, that was the devil’s snare; \\nflitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; mcgonagall \\ntransfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that \\nleaves quirrell’s spell, and snape’s ...” \\n\\nthey had reached another door. \\n\\n“all right?” harry whispered. \\n\\n“go on.” \\n\\nharry pushed it open. \\n\\na disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of \\nthem pull their robes up over their noses. eyes \\nwatering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a \\ntroll even larger than the one they had tackled, out \\ncold with a bloody lump on its head. \\n\\n“i’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” harry \\nwhispered as they stepped carefully over one of its \\nmassive legs. “come on, i can’t breathe.” \\n\\nhe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly \\ndaring to look at what came next — but there was \\nnothing very frightening in here, just a table with \\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a \\nline. \\n\\n“snape’s,” said harry. “what do we have to do?” \\n\\nthey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a \\nfire sprang up behind them in the doorway. it wasn’t \\nordinary fire either; it was purple. at the same \\n\\npage | 319 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading \\nonward. they were trapped. \\n\\n“look!” hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to \\nthe bottles. harry looked over her shoulder to read it: \\n\\ndanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \\n\\ntwo of us will help you, whichever you would find, \\n\\none among us seven will let you move ahead, \\n\\nanother will transport the drinker back instead, \\n\\ntwo among our number hold only nettle wine, \\n\\nthree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \\n\\nchoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \\n\\nto help you in your choice, we give you these clues \\nfour: \\n\\nfirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide \\n\\nyou will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; \\n\\nsecond, different are those who stand at either end, \\n\\nbut if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \\n\\nthird, as you see clearly, all are different size, \\n\\nneither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \\n\\nfourth, the second left and the second on the right \\n\\nare twins once you taste them, though different at first \\nsight \\n\\npage | 320 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhermione let out a great sigh and harry, amazed, saw \\nthat she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like \\ndoing. \\n\\n“brilliant,” said hermione. “this isn’t magic — it’s \\nlogic — a puzzle. a lot of the greatest wizards haven’t \\ngot an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.” \\n\\n“but so will we, won’t we?” \\n\\n“of course not,” said hermione. “everything we need \\nis here on this paper. seven bottles: three are poison; \\ntwo are wine; one will get us safely through the black \\nfire, and one will get us back through the purple.” \\n\\n“but how do we know which to drink?” \\n\\n“give me a minute.” \\n\\nhermione read the paper several times. then she \\nwalked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to \\nherself and pointing at them. at last, she clapped her \\nhands. \\n\\n“got it,” she said. “the smallest bottle will get us \\nthrough the black fire — toward the stone.” \\n\\nharry looked at the tiny bottle. \\n\\n“there’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. \\n“that’s hardly one swallow.” \\n\\nthey looked at each other. \\n\\n“which one will get you back through the purple \\nflames?” \\n\\nhermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end \\nof the line. \\n\\npage | 321 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“you drink that,” said harry. “no, listen, get back and \\nget ron. grab brooms from the flying-key room, \\nthey’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy — \\ngo straight to the owlery and send hedwig to \\ndumbledore, we need him. i might be able to hold \\nsnape off for a while, but i’m no match for him, \\nreally.” \\n\\n“but harry — what if you-know- who’s with him?” \\n\\n“well — i was lucky once, wasn’t i?” said harry, \\npointing at his scar. “i might get lucky again.” \\n\\nhermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at \\nharry and threw her arms around him. \\n\\n“hermionel” \\n\\n“harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” \\n\\n“i’m not as good as you,” said harry, very \\nembarrassed, as she let go of him. \\n\\n“me!” said hermione. “books! and cleverness! there \\nare more important things — friendship and bravery \\nand — oh harry — be carefull” \\n\\n“you drink first,” said harry. “you are sure which is \\nwhich, aren’t you?” \\n\\n“positive,” said hermione. she took a long drink from \\nthe round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \\n\\n“it’s not poison?” said harry anxiously. \\n\\n“no — but it’s like ice.” \\n\\n“quick, go, before it wears off.” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 322 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“good luck — take care — ” \\n\\n\\n\\n“go!” \\n\\nhermione turned and walked straight through the \\npurple fire. \\n\\nharry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest \\nbottle. he turned to face the black flames. \\n\\n“here i come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle \\nin one gulp. \\n\\nit was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. he \\nput the bottle down and walked forward; he braced \\nhimself, saw the black flames licking his body, but \\ncouldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see \\nnothing but dark fire — then he was on the other \\nside, in the last chamber. \\n\\nthere was already someone there — but it wasn’t \\nsnape. it wasn’t even voldemort. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 323 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe man with two faces \\n\\nit was quirrell. \\n\\n“you\\\\” gasped harry. \\n\\nquirrell smiled. his face wasn’t twitching at all. \\n\\n“me,” he said calmly. “i wondered whether i’d be \\nmeeting you here, potter.” \\n\\n“but i thought — snape — ” \\n\\n“severus?” quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual \\nquivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “yes, \\nseverus does seem the type, doesn’t he? so useful to \\nhave him swooping around like an overgrown bat. \\n\\nnext to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- \\nstuttering p-professor quirrell?” \\n\\nharry couldn’t take it in. this couldn’t be true, it \\ncouldn’t. \\n\\n“but snape tried to kill me!” \\n\\npage | 324 \\n\\n\\n\\n“no, no, no. / tried to kill you. your friend miss \\ngranger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed \\nto set fire to snape at that quidditch match. she \\nbroke my eye contact with you. another few seconds \\nand i’d have got you off that broom. i’d have managed \\nit before then if snape hadn’t been muttering a \\ncountercurse, trying to save you.” \\n\\n“snape was trying to save me?” \\n\\n“of course,” said quirrell coolly. “why do you think \\nhe wanted to referee your next match? he was trying \\nto make sure i didn’t do it again. funny, really ... he \\nneedn’t have bothered. i couldn’t do anything with \\ndumbledore watching. all the other teachers thought \\nsnape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning, he \\ndid make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of \\ntime, when after all that, i’m going to kill you tonight.” \\n\\nquirrell snapped his fingers. ropes sprang out of thin \\nair and wrapped themselves tightly around harry. \\n\\n“you’re too nosy to live, potter. scurrying around the \\nschool on halloween like that, for all i knew you’d \\nseen me coming to look at what was guarding the \\nstone.” \\n\\n“ you let the troll in?” \\n\\n“certainly. i have a special gift with trolls — you must \\nhave seen what i did to the one in the chamber back \\nthere? unfortunately, while everyone else was \\nrunning around looking for it, snape, who already \\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head \\nme off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to \\ndeath, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to \\nbite snape ’s leg off properly. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 325 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“now, wait quietly, potter. i need to examine this \\ninteresting mirror.” \\n\\nit was only then that harry realized what was \\nstanding behind quirrell. it was the mirror of erised. \\n\\n“this mirror is the key to finding the stone,” quirrell \\nmurmured, tapping his way around the frame. “trust \\ndumbledore to come up with something like this . . . \\nbut he’s in london ... i’ll be far away by the time he \\ngets back. ...” \\n\\nall harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell \\ntalking and stop him from concentrating on the \\nmirror. \\n\\n“i saw you and snape in the forest — ” he blurted out. \\n\\n“yes,” said quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to \\nlook at the back. “he was on to me by that time, \\ntrying to find out how far i’d got. he suspected me all \\nalong. tried to frighten me — as though he could, \\nwhen i had lord voldemort on my side. ...” \\n\\nquirrell came back out from behind the mirror and \\nstared hungrily into it. \\n\\n“i see the stone ... i’m presenting it to my master ... \\nbut where is it?” \\n\\nharry struggled against the ropes binding him, but \\nthey didn’t give. he had to keep quirrell from giving \\nhis whole attention to the mirror. \\n\\n“but snape always seemed to hate me so much.” \\n\\n“oh, he does,” said quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. \\nhe was at hogwarts with your father, didn’t you \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 326 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nknow? they loathed each other. but he never wanted \\nyou dead.” \\n\\n“but i heard you a few days ago, sobbing — i thought \\nsnape was threatening you. \\n\\nfor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across \\nquirrell’s face. \\n\\n“sometimes,” he said, “i find it hard to follow my \\nmaster’s instructions — he is a great wizard and i am \\nweak — ” \\n\\n“you mean he was there in the classroom with you?” \\nharry gasped. \\n\\n“he is with me wherever i go,” said quirrell quietly. “i \\nmet him when i traveled around the world. a foolish \\nyoung man i was then, full of ridiculous ideas about \\ngood and evil. lord voldemort showed me how wrong \\ni was. there is no good and evil, there is only power, \\nand those too weak to seek it. ... since then, i have \\nserved him faithfully, although i have let him down \\nmany times. he has had to be very hard on me.” \\nquirrell shivered suddenly. “he does not forgive \\nmistakes easily. when i failed to steal the stone from \\ngringotts, he was most displeased. he punished me \\n. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on \\nme. ...” \\n\\nquirrell’s voice trailed away. harry was remembering \\nhis trip to diagon alley — how could he have been so \\nstupid? he’d seen quirrell there that very day, shaken \\nhands with him in the leaky cauldron. \\n\\nquirrell cursed under his breath. \\n\\n“i don’t understand ... is the stone inside the mirror? \\nshould i break it?” \\n\\npage | 327 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry’s mind was racing. \\n\\n\\n\\nwhat i want more than anything else in the world at \\nthe moment, he thought, is to find the stone before \\nquirrell does. so if i look in the mirror, i should see \\nmy self finding it — which means i’ll see where it’s \\nhidden! but how can i look without quirrell realizing \\nwhat i’m up to? \\n\\nhe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass \\nwithout quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his \\nankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. quirrell \\nignored him. he was still talking to himself. \\n\\n“what does this mirror do? how does it work? help \\nme, master!” \\n\\nand to harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice \\nseemed to come from quirrell himself. \\n\\n“use the boy ... use the boy ...” \\n\\nquirrell rounded on harry. \\n\\n“yes — potter — come here.” \\n\\nhe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding \\nharry fell off. harry got slowly to his feet. \\n\\n“come here,” quirrell repeated. “look in the mirror \\nand tell me what you see.” \\n\\nharry walked toward him. \\n\\ni must lie, he thought desperately. i must look and lie \\nabout what i see, that’s all. \\n\\nquirrell moved close behind him. harry breathed in \\nthe funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell’s \\n\\npage | 328 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nturban. he closed his eyes, stepped in front of the \\nmirror, and opened them again. \\n\\nhe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. \\nbut a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. it \\nput its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- \\nred stone. it winked and put the stone back in its \\npocket — and as it did so, harry felt something heavy \\ndrop into his real pocket. somehow — incredibly — \\nhe’d gotten the stone. \\n\\n“well?” said quirrell impatiently. “what do you see?” \\nharry screwed up his courage. \\n\\n“i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore,” he \\ninvented. “i — i’ve won the house cup for gryffindor.” \\n\\nquirrell cursed again. \\n\\n“get out of the way,” he said. as harry moved aside, \\nhe felt the sorcerer’s stone against his leg. dare he \\nmake a break for it? \\n\\nbut he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice \\nspoke, though quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. \\n\\n“he lies ... he lies ...” \\n\\n“potter, come back here!” quirrell shouted. “tell me \\nthe truth! what did you just see?” \\n\\nthe high voice spoke again. \\n\\n“let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...” \\n\\n“master, you are not strong enough!” \\n\\n“i have strength enough ... for this. ...” \\n\\npage | 329 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry felt as if devil’s snare was rooting him to the \\nspot. he couldn’t move a muscle. petrified, he \\nwatched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap \\nhis turban. what was going on? the turban fell away. \\nquirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. \\n\\nthen he turned slowly on the spot. \\n\\nharry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a \\nsound. where there should have been a back to \\nquirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible \\nface harry had ever seen. it was chalk white with \\nglaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \\n\\n“harry potter ...” it whispered. \\n\\nharry tried to take a step backward but his legs \\nwouldn’t move. \\n\\n“see what i have become?” the face said. “mere \\nshadow and vapor ... i have form only when i can \\nshare another’s body . . . but there have always been \\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... \\nunicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks \\n. . . you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the \\nforest ... and once i have the elixir of life, i will be \\nable to create a body of my own. ... now ... why don’t \\nyou give me that stone in your pocket?” \\n\\nso he knew. the feeling suddenly surged back into \\nharry’s legs. he stumbled backward. \\n\\n“don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “better save your \\nown life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as \\nyour parents. ... they died begging me for mercy. ...” \\n\\n“liar!” harry shouted suddenly. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 330 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nquirrell was walking backward at him, so that \\nvoldemort could still see him. the evil face was now \\nsmiling. \\n\\n“how touching ...” it hissed. “i always value bravery. \\n\\n... yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... i killed your \\nfather first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but \\nyour mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to \\nprotect you. ... now give me the stone, unless you \\nwant her to have died in vain.” \\n\\n“never!” \\n\\nharry sprang toward the flame door, but voldemort \\nscreamed “seize him!” and the next second, harry \\nfelt quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. at once, a \\nneedle-sharp pain seared across harry’s scar; his \\nhead felt as though it was about to split in two; he \\nyelled, struggling with all his might, and to his \\nsurprise, quirrell let go of him. the pain in his head \\nlessened — he looked around wildly to see where \\nquirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, \\nlooking at his fingers — they were blistering before his \\neyes. \\n\\n“seize him! seize him!” shrieked voldemort again, \\nand quirrell lunged, knocking harry clean off his feet, \\nlanding on top of him, both hands around harry’s \\nneck — harry’s scar was almost blinding him with \\npain, yet he could see quirrell howling in agony. \\n\\n“master, i cannot hold him — my hands — my \\nhands!” \\n\\nand quirrell, though pinning harry to the ground \\nwith his knees, let go of his neck and stared, \\nbewildered, at his own palms — harry could see they \\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 331 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched \\nvoldemort. \\n\\nquirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, \\nbut harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed \\nquirrell’s face — \\n\\n“aaaargh!” \\n\\nquirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and \\nthen harry knew: quirrell couldn’t touch his bare \\nskin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only \\nchance was to keep hold of quirrell, keep him in \\nenough pain to stop him from doing a curse. \\n\\nharry jumped to his feet, caught quirrell by the arm, \\nand hung on as tight as he could. quirrell screamed \\nand tried to throw harry off — the pain in harry’s \\nhead was building — he couldn’t see — he could only \\nhear quirrell’s terrible shrieks and voldemort’s yells \\nof, “kill him! kill him!” and other voices, maybe in \\nharry’s own head, crying, “harry! harry!” \\n\\nhe felt quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew \\nall was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... \\ndown ... \\n\\nsomething gold was glinting just above him. the \\nsnitch! he tried to catch it, but his arms were too \\nheavy. \\n\\nhe blinked. it wasn’t the snitch at all. it was a pair of \\nglasses. how strange. \\n\\nhe blinked again. the smiling face of albus \\ndumbledore swam into view above him. \\n\\n“good afternoon, harry,” said dumbledore. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 332 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nharry stared at him. then he remembered: “sir! the \\nstone! it was quirrell! he’s got the stone! sir, quick — \\n\\n\\n\\n“calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the \\ntimes,” said dumbledore. “quirrell does not have the \\nstone.” \\n\\n“then who does? sir, i — ” \\n\\n“harry, please relax, or madam pomfrey will have me \\nthrown out.” \\n\\nharry swallowed and looked around him. he realized \\nhe must be in the hospital wing. he was lying in a bed \\nwith white linen sheets, and next to him was a table \\npiled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \\n\\n“tokens from your friends and admirers,” said \\ndumbledore, beaming. “what happened down in the \\ndungeons between you and professor quirrell is a \\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school \\nknows. i believe your friends misters fred and george \\nweasley were responsible for trying to send you a \\ntoilet seat. no doubt they thought it would amuse \\nyou. madam pomfrey, however, felt it might not be \\nvery hygienic, and confiscated it.” \\n\\n“how long have i been in here?” \\n\\n“three days. mr. ronald weasley and miss granger \\nwill be most relieved you have come round, they have \\nbeen extremely worried.” \\n\\n“but sir, the stone — ” \\n\\n“i see you are not to be distracted. very well, the \\nstone. professor quirrell did not manage to take it \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 333 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom you. i arrived in time to prevent that, although \\nyou were doing very well on your own, i must say.” \\n\\n“you got there? you got hermione’s owl?” \\n\\n“we must have crossed in midair. no sooner had i \\nreached london than it became clear to me that the \\nplace i should be was the one i had just left. i arrived \\njust in time to pull quirrell off you — ” \\n\\n“it was you.” \\n\\n“i feared i might be too late.” \\n\\n“you nearly were, i couldn’t have kept him off the \\nstone much longer — ” \\n\\n“not the stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly \\nkilled you. for one terrible moment there, i was afraid \\nit had. as for the stone, it has been destroyed.” \\n\\n“destroyed?” said harry blankly. “but your friend — \\nnicolas flamel — ” \\n\\n“oh, you know about nicolas?” said dumbledore, \\nsounding quite delighted. “you did do the thing \\nproperly, didn’t you? well, nicolas and i have had a \\nlittle chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” \\n\\n“but that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” \\n\\n“they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in \\norder and then, yes, they will die.” \\n\\ndumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on \\nharry’s face. \\n\\n“to one as young as you, i’m sure it seems incredible, \\nbut to nicolas and perenelle, it really is like going to \\n\\npage | 334 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbed after a very, very long day. after all, to the well- \\norganized mind, death is but the next great \\nadventure. you know, the stone was really not such a \\nwonderful thing. as much money and life as you \\ncould want! the two things most human beings would \\nchoose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a \\nknack of choosing precisely those things that are \\nworst for them.” \\n\\nharry lay there, lost for words. dumbledore hummed \\na little and smiled at the ceiling. \\n\\n“sir?” said harry. “i’ve been thinking ... sir — even if \\nthe stone’s gone, vol-, i mean, you-know-who — ” \\n\\n“call him voldemort, harry. always use the proper \\nname for things. fear of a name increases fear of the \\nthing itself.” \\n\\n“yes, sir. well, voldemort’s going to try other ways of \\ncoming back, isn’t he? i mean, he hasn’t gone, has \\nhe?” \\n\\n“no, harry, he has not. he is still out there \\nsomewhere, perhaps looking for another body to \\nshare ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. he \\nleft quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his \\nfollowers as his enemies. nevertheless, harry, while \\nyou may only have delayed his return to power, it will \\nmerely take someone else who is prepared to fight \\nwhat seems a losing battle next time — and if he is \\ndelayed again, and again, why, he may never return \\nto power.” \\n\\nharry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made \\nhis head hurt. then he said, “sir, there are some \\nother things i’d like to know, if you can tell me ... \\nthings i want to know the truth about. ...” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 335 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“the truth.” dumbledore sighed. “it is a beautiful and \\nterrible thing, and should therefore be treated with \\ngreat caution. however, i shall answer your questions \\nunless i have a very good reason not to, in which case \\ni beg you 11 forgive me. i shall not, of course, lie.” \\n\\n“well ... voldemort said that he only killed my mother \\nbecause she tried to stop him from killing me. but \\nwhy would he want to kill me in the first place?” \\n\\ndumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \\n\\n“alas, the first thing you ask me, i cannot tell you. \\n\\nnot today. not now. you will know, one day ... put it \\nfrom your mind for now, harry. when you are older . . . \\ni know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, \\nyou will know.” \\n\\nand harry knew it would be no good to argue. \\n\\n“but why couldn’t quirrell touch me?” \\n\\n“your mother died to save you. if there is one thing \\nvoldemort cannot understand, it is love. he didn’t \\nrealize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you \\nleaves its own mark. not a scar, no visible sign ... to \\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person \\nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection \\nforever. it is in your very skin. quirrell, full of hatred, \\ngreed, and ambition, sharing his soul with voldemort, \\ncould not touch you for this reason. it was agony to \\ntouch a person marked by something so good.” \\n\\ndumbledore now became very interested in a bird out \\non the windowsill, which gave harry time to dry his \\neyes on the sheet. when he had found his voice again, \\nharry said, “and the invisibility cloak — do you know \\nwho sent it to me?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 336 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“ah — your father happened to leave it in my \\npossession, and i thought you might like it.” \\ndumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “useful things ... your \\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens \\nto steal food when he was here.” \\n\\n“and there’s something else ...” \\n\\n“fire away.” \\n\\n“quirrell said snape — ” \\n\\n“professor snape, harry.” \\n\\n“yes, him — quirrell said he hates me because he \\nhated my father. is that true?” \\n\\n“well, they did rather detest each other. not unlike \\nyourself and mr. malfoy. and then, your father did \\nsomething snape could never forgive.” \\n\\n“what?” \\n\\n“he saved his life.” \\n\\n“what?” \\n\\n“yes ...” said dumbledore dreamily. “funny, the way \\npeople’s minds work, isn’t it? professor snape \\ncouldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... i do \\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year \\nbecause he felt that would make him and your father \\neven. then he could go back to hating your father’s \\nmemory in peace. ...” \\n\\nharry tried to understand this but it made his head \\npound, so he stopped. \\n\\n“and sir, there’s one more thing ...” \\n\\npage | 337 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“just the one?” \\n\\n\\n\\n“how did i get the stone out of the mirror?” \\n\\n“ah, now, i’m glad you asked me that. it was one of \\nmy more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, \\nthat’s saying something. you see, only one who \\nwanted to find the stone — find it, but not use it — \\nwould be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see \\nthemselves making gold or drinking elixir of life. my \\nbrain surprises even me sometimes. ... now, enough \\nquestions. i suggest you make a start on these \\nsweets. ah! bertie bott’s every flavor beans! i was \\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a \\nvomit-flavored one, and since then i’m afraid i’ve \\nrather lost my liking for them — but i think i’ll be safe \\nwith a nice toffee, don’t you?” \\n\\nhe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his \\nmouth. then he choked and said, “alas! ear wax!” \\n\\nmadam pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but \\nvery strict. \\n\\n“just five minutes,” harry pleaded. \\n\\n“absolutely not.” \\n\\n“you let professor dumbledore in. ...” \\n\\n“well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite \\ndifferent. you need rest.” \\n\\n“i am resting, look, lying down and everything. oh, go \\non, madam pomfrey ...” \\n\\n“oh, very well,” she said. “but five minutes only.” \\n\\nand she let ron and hermione in. \\n\\npage | 338 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“harryl” \\n\\n\\n\\nhermione looked ready to fling her arms around him \\nagain, but harry was glad she held herself in as his \\nhead was still very sore. \\n\\n“oh, harry, we were sure you were going to — \\ndumbledore was so worried — ” \\n\\n“the whole school’s talking about it,” said ron. “what \\nreally happened?” \\n\\nit was one of those rare occasions when the true story \\nis even more strange and exciting than the wild \\nrumors. harry told them everything: quirrell; the \\nmirror; the stone; and voldemort. ron and hermione \\nwere a very good audience; they gasped in all the \\nright places, and when harry told them what was \\nunder quirrell’s turban, hermione screamed out loud. \\n\\n“so the stone’s gone?” said ron finally. “flamel’s just \\ngoing to die?” \\n\\n“that’s what i said, but dumbledore thinks that — \\nwhat was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is \\nbut the next great adventure.’ ” \\n\\n“i always said he was off his rocker,” said ron, \\nlooking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \\n\\n“so what happened to you two?” said harry. \\n\\n“well, i got back all right,” said hermione. “i brought \\nron round — that took a while — and we were \\ndashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when \\nwe met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — \\nhe just said, ‘harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and \\nhurtled off to the third floor.” \\n\\npage | 339 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“d’you think he meant you to do it?” said ron. \\n“sending you your fathers cloak and everything?” \\n\\n“well,” hermione exploded, “if he did — i mean to say \\n— that’s terrible — you could have been killed.” \\n\\n“no, it isn’t,” said harry thoughtfully. “he’s a funny \\nman, dumbledore. i think he sort of wanted to give \\nme a chance. i think he knows more or less \\neverything that goes on here, you know. i reckon he \\nhad a pretty good idea we were going to try, and \\ninstead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to \\nhelp. i don’t think it was an accident he let me find \\nout how the mirror worked. it’s almost like he thought \\ni had the right to face voldemort if i could. ...” \\n\\n“yeah, dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said \\nron proudly. “listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- \\nof-year feast tomorrow. the points are all in and \\nslytherin won, of course — you missed the last \\nquidditch match, we were steamrollered by \\nravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.” \\n\\nat that moment, madam pomfrey bustled over. \\n\\n“you’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now out,” she \\nsaid firmly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafter a good night’s sleep, harry felt nearly back to \\nnormal. \\n\\n“i want to go to the feast,” he told madam pomfrey as \\nshe straightened his many candy boxes. “i can, can’t \\ni?” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 340 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to \\ngo,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion \\nprofessor dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts \\ncould be. “and you have another visitor.” \\n\\n“oh, good,” said harry. “who is it?” \\n\\nhagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. as usual \\nwhen he was indoors, hagrid looked too big to be \\nallowed. he sat down next to harry, took one look at \\nhim, and burst into tears. \\n\\n“it’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his \\nface in his hands. “i told the evil git how ter get past \\nfluffy! i told him! it was the only thing he didn’t \\nknow, an’ i told him! yeh could’ve died! all fer a \\ndragon egg! i’ll never drink again! i should be chucked \\nout an’ made ter live as a muggle!” \\n\\n“hagrid!” said harry, shocked to see hagrid shaking \\nwith grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into \\nhis beard. “hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, \\nthis is voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found \\nout even if you hadn’t told him.” \\n\\n“yeh could’ve died!” sobbed hagrid. “an’ don’ say the \\nname!” \\n\\n“voldemort!” harry bellowed, and hagrid was so \\nshocked, he stopped crying. “i’ve met him and i’m \\ncalling him by his name. please cheer up, hagrid, we \\nsaved the stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. have a \\nchocolate frog, i’ve got loads. ...” \\n\\nhagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and \\nsaid, “that reminds me. i’ve got yeh a present.” \\n\\n“it’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said harry \\nanxiously, and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \\n\\npage | 341 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“nah. dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter \\nfix it. ’course, he shoulda sacked me instead — \\nanyway, got y eh this ...” \\n\\nit seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. \\nharry opened it curiously. it was full of wizard \\nphotographs. smiling and waving at him from every \\npage were his mother and father. \\n\\n“sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, \\naskin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh \\nlike it?” \\n\\nharry couldn’t speak, but hagrid understood. \\n\\nharry made his way down to the end-of-year feast \\nalone that night. he had been held up by madam \\npomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one \\nlast checkup, so the great hall was already full. it \\nwas decked out in the slytherin colors of green and \\nsilver to celebrate slytherin ’s winning the house cup \\nfor the seventh year in a row. a huge banner showing \\nthe slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the \\nhigh table. \\n\\nwhen harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and \\nthen everybody started talking loudly at once. he \\nslipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the \\ngryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that \\npeople were standing up to look at him. \\n\\nfortunately, dumbledore arrived moments later. the \\nbabble died away. \\n\\n“another year gone!” dumbledore said cheerfully. \\n\\n“and i must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing \\nwaffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious \\nfeast. what a year it has been! hopefully your heads \\nare all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the \\npage | 342 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhole summer ahead to get them nice and empty \\nbefore next year starts. ... \\n\\n“now, as i understand it, the house cup here needs \\nawarding, and the points stand thus: in fourth place, \\ngryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in \\nthird, hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; \\nravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and \\nslytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.” \\n\\na storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the \\nslytherin table. harry could see draco malfoy banging \\nhis goblet on the table. it was a sickening sight. \\n\\n“yes, yes, well done, slytherin,” said dumbledore. \\n“however, recent events must be taken into account.” \\n\\nthe room went very still. the slytherins’ smiles faded \\na little. \\n\\n“ahem,” said dumbledore. “i have a few last-minute \\npoints to dish out. let me see. yes ... \\n\\n“first — to mr. ronald weasley ...” \\n\\nron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish \\nwith a bad sunburn. \\n\\n\"... for the best-played game of chess hogwarts has \\nseen in many years, i award gryffindor house fifty \\npoints.” \\n\\ngryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; \\nthe stars overhead seemed to quiver. percy could be \\nheard telling the other prefects, “my brother, you \\nknow! my youngest brother! got past mcgonagall’s \\ngiant chess set!” \\n\\nat last there was silence again. \\n\\npage | 343 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“second — to miss hermione granger . . . for the use of \\ncool logic in the face of fire, i award gryffindor house \\nfifty points.” \\n\\nhermione buried her face in her arms; harry strongly \\nsuspected she had burst into tears. gryffindors up \\nand down the table were beside themselves — they \\nwere a hundred points up. \\n\\n“third — to mr. harry potter ...” said dumbledore. \\n\\nthe room went deadly quiet. \"... for pure nerve and \\noutstanding courage, i award gryffindor house sixty \\npoints.” \\n\\nthe din was deafening. those who could add up while \\nyelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now \\nhad four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly \\nthe same as slytherin. they had tied for the house \\ncup — if only dumbledore had given harry just one \\nmore point. \\n\\ndumbledore raised his hand. the room gradually fell \\nsilent. \\n\\n“there are all kinds of courage,” said dumbledore, \\nsmiling. “it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up \\nto our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our \\nfriends. i therefore award ten points to mr. neville \\nlongbottom.” \\n\\nsomeone standing outside the great hall might well \\nhave thought some sort of explosion had taken place, \\nso loud was the noise that erupted from the \\ngryffindor table. harry, ron, and hermione stood up \\nto yell and cheer as neville, white with shock, \\ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging him. he \\nhad never won so much as a point for gryffindor \\nbefore. harry, still cheering, nudged ron in the ribs \\nand pointed at malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more \\npage | 344 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstunned and horrified if he’d just had the body-bind \\ncurse put on him. \\n\\n“which means,” dumbledore called over the storm of \\napplause, for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were \\ncelebrating the downfall of slytherin, “we need a little \\nchange of decoration.” \\n\\nhe clapped his hands. in an instant, the green \\nhangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; \\nthe huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering \\ngryffindor lion took its place. snape was shaking \\nprofessor mcgonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced \\nsmile. he caught harry’s eye and harry knew at once \\nthat snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one \\njot. this didn’t worry harry. it seemed as though life \\nwould be back to normal next year, or as normal as it \\never was at hogwarts. \\n\\nit was the best evening of harry’s life, better than \\nwinning at quidditch, or christmas, or knocking out \\nmountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. \\n\\nharry had almost forgotten that the exam results \\nwere still to come, but come they did. to their great \\nsurprise, both he and ron passed with good marks; \\nhermione, of course, had the best grades of the first \\nyears. even neville scraped through, his good \\nherbology mark making up for his abysmal potions \\none. they had hoped that goyle, who was almost as \\nstupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he \\nhad passed, too. it was a shame, but as ron said, you \\ncouldn’t have everything in life. \\n\\nand suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their \\ntrunks were packed, neville’s toad was found lurking \\nin a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all \\nstudents, warning them not to use magic over the \\nholidays (“i always hope they’ll forget to give us \\npage | 345 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthese,” said fred weasley sadly); hagrid was there to \\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across \\nthe lake; they were boarding the hogwarts express; \\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became \\ngreener and tidier; eating bertie bott’s every flavor \\nbeans as they sped past muggle towns; pulling off \\ntheir wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; \\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at \\nking’s cross station. \\n\\nit took quite a while for them all to get off the \\nplatform. a wizened old guard was up by the ticket \\nbarrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and \\nthrees so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting \\nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles. \\n\\n“you must come and stay this summer,” said ron, \\n“both of you — i’ll send you an owl.” \\n\\n“thanks,” said harry, “i’ll need something to look \\nforward to.” \\n\\npeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the \\ngateway back to the muggle world. some of them \\ncalled: \\n\\n“bye, harry!” \\n\\n“see you, potter!” \\n\\n“still famous,” said ron, grinning at him. \\n\\n“not where i’m going, i promise you,” said harry. \\n\\nhe, ron, and hermione passed through the gateway \\ntogether. \\n\\n“there he is, mom, there he is, look!” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 346 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was ginny weasley, ron’s younger sister, but she \\nwasn’t pointing at ron. \\n\\n“harry potter!” she squealed. “look, mom! i can see \\n“be quiet, ginny, and it’s rude to point.” \\n\\nmrs. weasley smiled down at them. \\n\\n“busy year?” she said. \\n\\n“very,” said harry. “thanks for the fudge and the \\nsweater, mrs. weasley.” \\n\\n“oh, it was nothing, dear.” \\n\\n“ready, are you?” \\n\\nit was uncle vernon, still purple-faced, still \\nmustached, still looking furious at the nerve of harry, \\ncarrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary \\npeople. behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley, \\nlooking terrified at the very sight of harry. \\n\\n“you must be harry’s family!” said mrs. weasley. \\n\\n“in a manner of speaking,” said uncle vernon. “hurry \\nup, boy, we haven’t got all day.” he walked away. \\n\\nharry hung back for a last word with ron and \\nhermione. \\n\\n“see you over the summer, then.” \\n\\n“hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said \\nhermione, looking uncertainly after uncle vernon, \\nshocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 347 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“oh, i will,” said harry, and they were surprised at \\nthe grin that was spreading over his face. “ they don’t \\nknow we’re not allowed to use magic at home. i’m \\ngoing to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer...” \\n\\n\\n\\npage | 348 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

craning over garden fences spying  on the neighbors the dursley s had a small son  called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer  boy anywhere   the dursleys had everything they wanted but they  also had a secret and their greatest fear was that  somebody would discover it they didnt think they  could bear it if anyone found out about the potters  mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt         met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended  she didnt have a sister because her sister and her  goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it  was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think  what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in  the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a  small son too but they had never even seen him   this boy was another good reason for keeping the  potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a  child like that   when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray  tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the  cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and  mysterious things would soon be happening all over  the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out  his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley  gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming  dudley into his high chair   none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past  the window   at half past eight mr dursley picked up his  briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and  tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because  dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his  cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley  as he left the house he got into his car and backed  out of number fours drive   it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the  first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a  map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he  had seen   then he jerked his head around to look  again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner  of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what  could he have been thinking of it must have been a  trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at         the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around  the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his  mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet  drive   no looking at the sign cats couldnt read  maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake  and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward  town he thought of nothing except a large order of  drills he was hoping to get that day   but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his  mind by something else as he sat in the usual  morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that  there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people  about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear  people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups  you saw on young people he supposed this was some  stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the  steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these  weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering  excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see  that a couple of them werent young at all why that  man had to be older than he was and wearing an  emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it  struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly  stunt   these people were obviously collecting for  something  yes that would be it the traffic moved  on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the  grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills   mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in  his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might  have found it harder to concentrate on drills that  morning he didnt see the owls swooping past in  broad daylight though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed openmouthed as owl after  owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an  owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a  perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five  different people he made several important telephone         calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good  mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch  his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a  bun from the bakery   hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he  passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed  them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but  they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering  excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting  tin it was on his way back past them clutching a  large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words  of what they were saying   the potters thats right thats what i heard         yes their son harry      mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he  looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say  something to them but thought better of it   he dashed back across the road hurried up to his  office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing  his home number when he changed his mind he put  the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no he was being stupid potter wasnt  such an unusual name he was sure there were lots  of people called potter who had a son called harry  come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew  was called harry hed never even seen the boy it  might have been harvey or harold there was no  point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so  upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame  her   if hed had a sister like that  but all the  same those people in cloaks             he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that  afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into  someone just outside the door   sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled  and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr  dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet  cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost  knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split  into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that  made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today rejoice for you  knowwho has gone at last even muggles like  yourself should be celebrating this happy happy  day   and the old man hugged mr dursley around the  middle and walked off   mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been  hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he  had been called a muggle whatever that was he was  rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things which he had never  hoped before because he didnt approve of  imagination   as he pulled into the driveway of number four the  first thing he saw   and it didnt improve his mood    was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was  now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the  same one it had the same markings around its eyes   shoo said mr dursley loudly   the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look   was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered  trying to pull himself together he let himself into the          house he was still determined not to mention  anything to his wife   mrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told  him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems  with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new  word wont mr dursley tried to act normally  when dudley had been put to bed he went into the  living room in time to catch the last report on the  evening news   and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported  that the nations owls have been behaving very  unusually today although owls normally hunt at  night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have  been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in  every direction since sunrise experts are unable to  explain why the owls have suddenly changed their  sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a  grin most mysterious and now over to jim  mcguffin with the weather going to be any more  showers of owls tonight jim   well ted said the weatherman i dont know about  that but its not only the owls that have been acting  oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire  and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that  instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a  downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have  been celebrating bonfire night early   its not until  next week folks but i can promise a wet night  tonight   mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars  all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious  people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a  whisper about the potters               mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two  cups of tea it was no good hed have to say  something to her he cleared his throat nervously er    petunia dear   you havent heard from your sister  lately have you   as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and  angry after all they normally pretended she didnt  have a sister   no she said sharply why   funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled  owls    shooting stars    and there were a lot of  funnylooking people in town today    so snapped mrs dursley   well i just thought  maybe  it was something to  do with  you know  her crowd   mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr  dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed  heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare  instead he said as casually as he could their son    hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he   i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly   whats his name again howard isnt it   harry nasty common name if you ask me   oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking  horribly yes i quite agree   he didnt say another word on the subject as they  went upstairs to bed while mrs dursley was in the  bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window          and peered down into the front garden the cat was  still there it was staring down privet drive as though  it were waiting for something   was he imagining things could all this have  anything to do with the potters if it did  if it got out  that they were related to a pair of   well he didnt  think he could bear it   the dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep  quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over  in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell  asleep was that even if the potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and  mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and  petunia thought about them and their kind  he  couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up  in anything that might be going on   he yawned and  turned over   it couldnt affect them    how very wrong he was   mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy  sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no  sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet  drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door  slammed on the next street nor when two owls  swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight  before the cat moved at all   a man appeared on the corner the cat had been  watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd  have thought hed just popped out of the ground the  cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet  drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the  silver of his hair and beard which were both long          enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long  robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and  highheeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light  bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles  and his nose was very long and crooked as though it  had been broken at least twice this mans name was  albus dumbledore   albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had  just arrived in a street where everything from his  name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy  rummaging in his cloak looking for something but  he did seem to realize he was being watched because  he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still  staring at him from the other end of the street for  some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse  him he chuckled and muttered i should have  known   he found what he was looking for in his inside  pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he  flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it  the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he  clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into  darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter  until the only lights left on the whole street were two  tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of  the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their  window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they  wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening  down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the put  outer back inside his cloak and set off down the  street toward number four where he sat down on the  wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a  moment he spoke to it   fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall            he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone  instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking  woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the  shape of the markings the cat had had around its  eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one  her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she  looked distinctly ruffled   how did you know it was me she asked   my dear professor ive never seen a cat sit so stiffly   youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all  day said professor mcgonagall   all day when you could have been celebrating i  must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my  way here   professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily   oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said  impatiently youd think theyd be a bit more careful  but no   even the muggles have noticed somethings  going on it was on their news she jerked her head  back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i  heard it flocks of owls  shooting stars  well  theyre not completely stupid they were bound to  notice something shooting stars down in kent   ill  bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much  sense   you cant blame them said dumbledore gently  weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven  years   i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably   but thats no reason to lose our heads people are  being downright careless out on the streets in broad          daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes  swapping rumors   she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore  here as though hoping he was going to tell her  something but he didnt so she went on a fine  thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho  seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found  out about us all i suppose he really has gone  dumbledore   it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have  much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon  drop   a what   a lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im  rather fond of   no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as  though she didnt think this was the moment for  lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has  gone      my dear professor surely a sensible person like  yourself can call him by his name all this you  knowwho nonsense   for eleven years i have been  trying to persuade people to call him by his proper  name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but  dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we  keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any  reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name   i know you havent said professor mcgonagall  sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre  different everyone knows youre the only one you  know oh all right voldemort was frightened of          you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort  had powers i will never have     only because youre too   well   noble to use  them   its lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since  madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at  dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to  the rumors that are flying around you know what  everyones saying about why hes disappeared   about what finally stopped him   it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the  point she was most anxious to discuss the real  reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all  day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she  fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she  did now it was plain that whatever everyone was  saying she was not going to believe it until  dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore  however was choosing another lemon drop and did  not answer   what theyre saying she pressed on is that last  night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he  went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and  james potter are   are   that theyre   dead   dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall  gasped   lily and james  i cant believe it  i didnt want to  believe it  oh albus    dumbledore reached out and patted her on the  shoulder i know  i know  he said heavily          professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went  on thats not all theyre saying he tried to kill the  potters son harry but   he couldnt he couldnt  kill that little boy no one knows why or how but  theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter  voldemorts power somehow broke   and thats why  hes gone   dumbledore nodded glumly   its   its true faltered professor mcgonagall after  all hes done  all the people hes killed  he couldnt  kill a little boy its just astounding  of all the  things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven  did harry survive   we can only guess said dumbledore we may  never know   professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief  and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden  watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very  odd watch it had twelve hands but no numbers  instead little planets were moving around the edge it  must have made sense to dumbledore though  because he put it back in his pocket and said  hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be  here by the way   yes said professor mcgonagall and i dont  suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all  places   ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle  theyre the only family he has left now   you dont mean   you cant mean the people who  live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her          feet and pointing at number four dumbledore   you  cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt  find two people who are less like us and theyve got  this son   i saw him kicking his mother all the way  up the street screaming for sweets harry potter  come and live here   its the best place for him said dumbledore firmly  his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything  to him when hes older ive written them a letter   a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter these  people will never understand him hell be famous    a legend   i wouldnt be surprised if today was  known as harry potter day in the future   there will  be books written about harry   every child in our  world will know his name   exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously  over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be  enough to turn any boys head famous before he can  walk and talk famous for something he wont even  remember cant you see how much better off hell be  growing up away from all that until hes ready to take  it     professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her  mind swallowed and then said yes   yes youre  right of course but how is the boy getting here  dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though  she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it   hagrids bringing him   you think it   wise   to trust hagrid with  something as important as this            i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore   im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said  professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant  pretend hes not careless he does tend to   what  was that   a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around  them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and  down the street for some sign of a headlight it  swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky    and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed  on the road in front of them   if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man  sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a  normal man and at least five times as wide he looked  simply too big to be allowed and so wild   long  tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his  face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his  feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in  his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of  blankets   hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at  last and where did you get that motorcycle   borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the  giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he  spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him  sir   no problems were there   no sir   house was almost destroyed but i got him  out all right before the muggles started swarmin  around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol            dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward  over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a  baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair  over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped  cut like a bolt of lightning   is that where    whispered professor mcgonagall   yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever   couldnt you do something about it dumbledore   even if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy   i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect  map of the london underground well   give him  here hagrid   wed better get this over with   dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned  toward the dursleys house   could i   could i say goodbye to him sir asked  hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry  and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl  like a wounded dog   shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the  muggles   sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted  handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cc  cant stand it   lily an james dead   an poor little  harry off ter live with muggles      yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself  hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall  whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as  dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and  walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the         doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it  inside harrys blankets and then came back to the  other two for a full minute the three of them stood  and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders  shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and  the twinkling light that usually shone from  dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out   well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no  business staying here we may as well go and join the  celebrations   yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice id best  get this bike away g night professor mcgonagall    professor dumbledore sir   wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid  swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the  engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off  into the night   i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall  said dumbledore nodding to her professor  mcgonagall blew her nose in reply   dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put  outer he clicked it once and twelve balls of light  sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive  glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a  tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end  of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets  on the step of number four   good luck harry he murmured he turned on his  heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone   a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which  lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last          place you would expect astonishing things to happen  harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without  waking up one small hand closed on the letter  beside him and he slept on not knowing he was  special not knowing he was famous not knowing he  would be woken in a few hours time by mrs   dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put  out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next  few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin  dudley  he couldnt know that at this very  moment people meeting in secret all over the country  were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed  voices to harry potter   the boy who lived              the vanashig glass   nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had  woken up to find their nephew on the front step but  privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose  on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass  number four on the dursleys front door it crept into  their living room which was almost exactly the same  as it had been on the night when mr dursley had  seen that fateful news report about the owls only the  photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how  much time had passed ten years ago there had been  lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach  ball wearing differentcolored bonnets   but dudley  dursley was no longer a baby and now the  photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first  bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer  game with his father being hugged and kissed by his  mother the room held no sign at all that another boy  lived in the house too   yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment  but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it            was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the  day   up get up now   harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door  again   up she screeched harry heard her walking toward  the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan  being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and  tried to remember the dream he had been having it  had been a good one there had been a flying  motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the  same dream before   his aunt was back outside the door   are you up yet she demanded   nearly said harry   well get a move on i want you to look after the  bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want  everything perfect on duddys birthday   harry groaned   what did you say his aunt snapped through the  door   nothing nothing    dudleys birthday   how could he have forgotten  harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for  socks he found a pair under his bed and after  pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry  was used to spiders because the cupboard under the  stairs was full of them and that was where he slept         when he was dressed he went down the hall into the  kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all  dudleys birthday presents it looked as though  dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not  to mention the second television and the racing bike  exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a  mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated  exercise   unless of course it involved punching  somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry  but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it  but he was very fast   perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark  cupboard but harry had always been small and  skinny for his age he looked even smaller and  skinnier than he really was because all he had to  wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was  about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin  face knobbly knees black hair and bright green  eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot  of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had  punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked  about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his  forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he  had had it as long as he could remember and the  first question he could ever remember asking his  aunt petunia was how he had gotten it   in the car crash when your parents died she had  said and dont ask questions   dont ask questions   that was the first rule for a  quiet life with the dursleys   uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was  turning over the bacon   comb your hair he barked by way of a morning  greeting          about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top  of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a  haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the  rest of the boys in his class put together but it made  no difference his hair simply grew that way   all over  the place   harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in  the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like  uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much  neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair  that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia  often said that dudley looked like a baby angel    harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a  wig   harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table  which was difficult as there wasnt much room  dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his  face fell   thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and  father thats two less than last year   darling you havent counted auntie marges present  see its here under this big one from mommy and  daddy   all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red  in the face harry who could see a huge dudley  tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as  fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over   aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because  she said quickly and well buy you another two  presents while were out today hows that popkin  two more presents is that all right            dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard  work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty   thirty    thirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia   oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the  nearest parcel all right then   uncle vernon chuckled   little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his  father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair   at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia  went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon  watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video  camera a remote control airplane sixteen new  computer games and a vcr he was ripping the  paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came  back from the telephone looking both angry and  worried   bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her  leg she cant take him she jerked her head in  harrys direction   dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart  gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his  parents took him and a friend out for the day to  adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the  movies every year harry was left behind with mrs  figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away   harry hated it there the whole house smelled of  cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs  of all the cats shed ever owned   now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at  harry as though hed planned this harry knew he          ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg  but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would  be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies  snowy mr paws and tufty again   we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested   dont be silly vernon she hates the boy   the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as  though he wasnt there   or rather as though he was  something very nasty that couldnt understand them  like a slug   what about whatshername your friend    yvonne   on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia   you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully  hed be able to watch what he wanted on television  for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys  computer    aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a  lemon   and come back and find the house in ruins she  snarled   i wont blow up the house said harry but they  werent listening   i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt  petunia slowly  and leave him in the car    that cars new hes not sitting in it alone             dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really  crying   it had been years since hed really cried    but he knew that if he screwed up his face and  wailed his mother would give him anything he  wanted   dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him  spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms  around him   i  dont  want  him  ttto come dudley  yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp  spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through  the gap in his mothers arms   just then the doorbell rang   oh good lord  theyre here said aunt petunia frantically   and a  moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss  walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy  with a face like a rat he was usually the one who  held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley  hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once   half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his  luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with  piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first  time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able  to think of anything else to do with him but before  theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside   im warning you he had said putting his large  purple face right up close to harrys im warning you  now boy   any funny business anything at all    and youll be in that cupboard from now until  christmas   im not going to do anything said harry honestly            but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did     the problem was strange things often happened  around harry and it was just no good telling the  dursleys he didnt make them happen   once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from  the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all  had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair  so short he was almost bald except for his bangs  which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had  laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless  night imagining school the next day where he was  already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped  glasses next morning however he had gotten up to  find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt  petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week  in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to  explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown  back so quickly   another time aunt petunia had been trying to force  him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown  with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it  over his head the smaller it seemed to become until  finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but  certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided  it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great  relief harry wasnt punished   on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble  for being found on the roof of the school kitchens  dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when  as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he  was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had  received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress  telling them harry had been climbing school  buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at  uncle vernon through the locked door of his         cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans  outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the  wind must have caught him in midjump   but today nothing was going to go wrong it was even  worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the  day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or  mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living room   while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt  petunia he liked to complain about things people at  work harry the council harry the bank and harry  were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning  it was motorcycles    roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums  he said as a motorcycle overtook them   i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry  remembering suddenly it was flying   uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he  turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry  his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache  motorcycles dont fly   dudley and piers sniggered   i know they dont said harry it was only a dream   but he wished he hadnt said anything if there was  one thing the dursleys hated even more than his  asking questions it was his talking about anything  acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a  dream or even a cartoon   they seemed to think he  might get dangerous ideas   it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was  crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley          and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance  and then because the smiling lady in the van had  asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry  him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it  wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they  watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked  remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond   harry had the best morning hed had in a long time  he was careful to walk a little way apart from the  dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting  to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt  fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they  ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a  tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have  enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him  another one and harry was allowed to finish the first   harry felt afterward that he should have known it  was all too good to last   after lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool  and dark in there with lit windows all along the  walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes  were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and  stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge  poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons  dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it  could have wrapped its body twice around uncle  vernons car and crushed it into a trash can   but at  the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was  fast asleep   dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass  staring at the glistening brown coils   make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon  tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge            do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped  the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake  just snoozed on   this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away   harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently  at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it  had died of boredom itself   no company except  stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass  trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than  having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only  visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to  wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the  house   the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly  very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a  level with harrys   it winked   harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if  anyone was watching they werent he looked back  at the snake and winked too   the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and  dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave  harry a look that said quite plainly   i get that all the time   i know harry murmured through the glass though  he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be  really annoying   the snake nodded vigorously   where do you come from anyway harry asked          the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the  glass harry peered at it   boa constrictor brazil   was it nice there   the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again  and harry read on this specimen was bred in the  zoo oh i see   so youve never been to brazil   as the snake shook its head a deafening shout  behind harry made both of them jump dudley  mr dursley come and look at this snake  you wont believe what its doing   dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he  could   out of the way you he said punching harry in the  ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the  concrete floor what came next happened so fast no  one saw how it happened   one second piers and  dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the  next they had leapt back with howls of horror   harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa  constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was  uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor  people throughout the reptile house screamed and  started running for the exits   as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have  sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come   thanksss amigo   the keeper of the reptile house was in shock            but the glass he kept saying where did the glass  go    the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of  strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over  again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as  harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything  except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but  by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car  dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off  his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to  squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at  least was piers calming down enough to say harry  was talking to it werent you harry   uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the  house before starting on harry he was so angry he  could hardly speak he managed to say go    cupboard   stay   no meals before he collapsed  into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get  him a large brandy   harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing  he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and  he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet   until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the  kitchen for some food   hed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten  miserable years as long as he could remember ever  since hed been a baby and his parents had died in  that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car  when his parents had died sometimes when he  strained his memory during long hours in his  cupboard he came up with a strange vision a  blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his  forehead this he supposed was the crash though  he couldnt imagine where all the green light came  from he couldnt remember his parents at all his         aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of  course he was forbidden to ask questions there were  no photographs of them in the house   when he had been younger harry had dreamed and  dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take  him away but it had never happened the dursleys  were his only family yet sometimes he thought or  maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to  know him very strange strangers they were too a  tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once  while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley  after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt  petunia had rushed them out of the shop without  buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed  all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus   a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually  shaken his hand in the street the other day and then  walked away without a word the weirdest thing  about all these people was the way they seemed to  vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look   at school harry had no one everybody knew that  dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his  baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody  liked to disagree with dudleys gang                  the letters from no one   the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned  harry his longestever punishment by the time he  was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer  holidays had started and dudley had already broken  his new video camera crashed his remote control  airplane and first time out on his racing bike  knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet  drive on her crutches   harry was glad school was over but there was no  escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every  single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were  all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and  stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of  them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite  sport harry hunting   this was why harry spent as much time as possible  out of the house wandering around and thinking  about the end of the holidays where he could see a  tiny ray of hope when september came he would be  going off to secondary school and for the first time in        his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been  accepted at uncle vernons old private school  smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry  on the other hand was going to stonewall high the  local public school dudley thought this was very  funny   they stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day  at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs  and practice   no thanks said harry the poor toilets never had  anything as horrible as your head down it   it might  be sick then he ran before dudley could work out  what hed said   one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london  to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs  figgs mrs figg wasnt as bad as usual it turned out  shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and  she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she  let harry watch television and gave him a bit of  chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for  several years   that evening dudley paraded around the living room  for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings  boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers  and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried  knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the  teachers werent looking this was supposed to be  good training for later life   as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers  uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest  moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and  said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins  he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt            trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs  might already have cracked from trying not to laugh     k k k     there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next  morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed  to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he  went to have a look the tub was full of what looked  like dirty rags swimming in gray water   whats this he asked aunt petunia her lips  tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a  question   your new school uniform she said   harry looked in the bowl again   oh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wet   dont be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing  some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just  like everyone elses when ive finished   harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not  to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to  think about how he was going to look on his first day  at stonewall high   like he was wearing bits of old  elephant skin probably   dudley and uncle vernon came in both with  wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new  uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as  usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which  he carried everywhere on the table   they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters  on the doormat          get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from  behind his paper   make harry get it   get the mail harry   make dudley get it   poke him with your smelting stick dudley   harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the  mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard  from uncle vernons sister marge who was  vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope  that looked like a bill and   a letter for harry   harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging  like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole  life had written to him who would he had no  friends no other relatives   he didnt belong to the  library so hed never even got rude notes asking for  books back yet here it was a letter addressed so  plainly there could be no mistake   mr h potter   the cupboard under the stairs   privet drive  little whinging  surrey   the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish  parchment and the address was written in emerald  green ink there was no stamp            turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry  saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion  an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large  letter h   hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the  kitchen what are you doing checking for letter  bombs he chuckled at his own joke   harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his  letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the  postcard sat down and slowly began to open the  yellow envelope   uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust  and flipped over the postcard   marges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny  whelk    dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got  something   harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which  was written on the same heavy parchment as the  envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand  by uncle vernon   thats mine said harry trying to snatch it back   whod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon  shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at  it his face went from red to green faster than a set of  traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds  it was the grayish white of old porridge   pppetunia he gasped            dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle  vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia  took it curiously and read the first line for a moment  it looked as though she might faint she clutched her  throat and made a choking noise   vernon oh my goodness   vernon   they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten  that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley  wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a  sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick   i want to read that letter he said loudly   i want to read it said harry furiously as its mine   get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing  the letter back inside its envelope   harry didnt move   i want my letter he shouted   let me see it demanded dudley   out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry  and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw  them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind  them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but  silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole  dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one  ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack  between door and floor   vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering  voice look at the address   how could they possibly  know where he sleeps you dont think theyre  watching the house          watching   spying   might be following us  muttered uncle vernon wildly   but what should we do vernon should we write  back tell them we dont want      harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes  pacing up and down the kitchen   no he said finally no well ignore it if they dont  get an answer  yes thats best  we wont do  anything    but      im not having one in the house petunia didnt we  swear when we took him in wed stamp out that  dangerous nonsense   that evening when he got back from work uncle  vernon did something hed never done before he  visited harry in his cupboard   wheres my letter said harry the moment uncle  vernon had squeezed through the door whos  writing to me   no one it was addressed to you by mistake said  uncle vernon shortly i have burned it   it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my  cupboard on it   silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of  spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep  breaths and then forced his face into a smile which  looked quite painful            er   yes harry   about this cupboard your aunt  and i have been thinking  youre really getting a bit  big for it    we think it might be nice if you moved  into dudleys second bedroom   why said harry   dont ask questions snapped his uncle take this  stuff upstairs now   the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for  uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors  usually uncle vernons sister marge one where  dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys  and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it  only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything  he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat  down on the bed and stared around him nearly  everything in here was broken the monthold video  camera was lying on top of a small working tank  dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors  dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television  set which hed put his foot through when his favorite  program had been canceled there was a large  birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley  had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was  up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley  had sat on it other shelves were full of books they  were the only things in the room that looked as  though theyd never been touched   from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling  at his mother i dont want him in there  i need  that room  make him get out    harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday  hed have given anything to be up here today hed  rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than  up here without it          next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet  dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his  father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose  kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through  the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room  back harry was thinking about this time yesterday  and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall  uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each  other darkly   when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to  be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get  it they heard him banging things with his smelting  stick all the way down the hall then he shouted  theres another one mr h potter the smallest  bedroom  privet drive       with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his  seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him  uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to  get the letter from him which was made difficult by  the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around  the neck from behind after a minute of confused  fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the  smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up  gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his  hand   go to your cupboard   i mean your bedroom he  wheezed at harry dudley   go   just go   harry walked round and round his new room  someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and  they seemed to know he hadnt received his first  letter surely that meant theyd try again and this  time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a plan   the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next  morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed          silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole  downstairs without turning on any of the lights   he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of  privet drive and get the letters for number four first  his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall  toward the front door     aaaaarrrgh     harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something  big and squashy on the doormat   something alive   lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry  realized that the big squashy something had been his  uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot  of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making  sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been  trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an  hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea  harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by  the time he got back the mail had arrived right into  uncle vernons lap harry could see three letters  addressed in green ink   i want    he began but uncle vernon was tearing  the letters into pieces before his eyes   uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at  home and nailed up the mail slot   see he explained to aunt petunia through a  mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll  just give up   im not sure thatll work vernon   oh these peoples minds work in strange ways  petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle          vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of  fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him   on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for  harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they  had been pushed under the door slotted through the  sides and a few even forced through the small  window in the downstairs bathroom   uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all  the letters he got out a hammer and nails and  boarded up the cracks around the front and back  doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe  through the tulips as he worked and jumped at  small noises   on saturday things began to get out of hand  twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the  house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two  dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had  handed aunt petunia through the living room  window while uncle vernon made furious telephone  calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find  someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the  letters in her food processor   who on earth wants to talk to you this badly  dudley asked harry in amazement         on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the  breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy   no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully  as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no  damn letters today               something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney  as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of  the head next moment thirty or forty letters came  pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys  ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch  one     out out   uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and  threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and  dudley had run out with their arms over their faces  uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could  hear the letters still streaming into the room  bouncing off the walls and floor   that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak  calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at  the same time i want you all back here in five  minutes ready to leave were going away just pack  some clothes no arguments   he looked so dangerous with half his mustache  missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later  they had wrenched their way through the boardedup  doors and were in the car speeding toward the  highway dudley was sniffling in the back seat his  father had hit him round the head for holding them  up while he tried to pack his television vcr and  computer in his sports bag   they drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt  dare ask where they were going every now and then  uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in  the opposite direction for a while   shake em off  shake em off he would mutter  whenever he did this            they didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall  dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day  in his life he was hungry hed missed five television  programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so  long without blowing up an alien on his computer   uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy  looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley  and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp  musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake  sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of  passing cars and wondering   they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on  toast for breakfast the next day they had just  finished when the owner of the hotel came over to  their table    scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i  got about an undred of these at the front desk   she held up a letter so they could read the green ink  address   mr h potter   room     railview hotel   cokeworth   harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon  knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared   ill take them said uncle vernon standing up  quickly and following her from the dining room            wouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt  petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle  vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was  looking for none of them knew he drove them into  the middle of a forest got out looked around shook  his head got back in the car and off they went again  the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed  field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the  top of a multilevel parking garage   daddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt  petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had  parked at the coast locked them all inside the car  and disappeared   it started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the  car dudley sniveled   its monday he told his mother the great  humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with  a television   monday this reminded harry of something if it was  monday   and you could usually count on dudley to  know the days of the week because of television    then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh  birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly  fun   last year the dursleys had given him a coat  hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socks still  you werent eleven every day   uncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was  also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer  aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought   found the perfect place he said come on   everyone out            it was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was  pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at  sea perched on top of the rock was the most  miserable little shack you could imagine one thing  was certain there was no television in there   storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon  gleefully clapping his hands together and this  gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat   a toothless old man came ambling up to them  pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat  bobbing in the irongray water below them   ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon  so all aboard   it was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain  crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped  their faces after what seemed like hours they  reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and  sliding led the way to the brokendown house   the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of  seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the  wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty  there were only two rooms   uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips  each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the  empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up   could do with some of those letters now eh he said  cheerfully   he was in a very good mood obviously he thought  nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a  storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though  the thought didnt cheer him up at all          as night fell the promised storm blew up around  them spray from the high waves splattered the walls  of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy  windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in  the second room and made up a bed for dudley on  the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off  to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find  the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under  the thinnest most ragged blanket   the storm raged more and more ferociously as the  night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and  turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach  rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned  by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight  the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was  dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told  harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and  watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the  dursleys would remember at all wondering where the  letter writer was now   five minutes to go harry heard something creak  outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in  although he might be warmer if it did four minutes  to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so  full of letters when they got back that hed be able to  steal one somehow   three minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard  on the rock like that and two minutes to go what  was that funny crunching noise was the rock  crumbling into the sea   one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds   twenty  ten  nine   maybe hed wake dudley  up just to annoy him   three  two  one    boom          the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright  staring at the door someone was outside knocking  to come in              the keeper of the keys   boom they knocked again dudley jerked awake   wheres the cannon he said stupidly   there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon  came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in  his hands   now they knew what had been in the  long thin package he had brought with them   whos there he shouted i warn you   im armed   there was a pause then     smash   the door was hit with such force that it swung clean  off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat  on the floor   a giant of a man was standing in the doorway his  face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy  mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could         make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under  all the hair   the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so  that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down  picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its  frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little  he turned to look at them all   couldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not  been an easy journey    he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen  with fear   budge up yeh great lump said the stranger   dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother  who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon   an heres harry said the giant   harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face  and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile   las time i saw you you was only a baby said the  giant yeh look a lot like yer dad but yehve got yer  moms eyes   uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise   i demand that you leave at once sir he said you  are breaking and entering   ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the  giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the  gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot  as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw  it into a corner of the room          uncle vernon made another funny noise like a  mouse being trodden on   anyway   harry said the giant turning his back  on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got  summat fer yeh here   i mighta sat on it at some  point but itll taste all right   from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled  a slightly squashed box harry opened it with  trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate  cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green  icing   harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank  you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth  and what he said instead was who are you   the giant chuckled   true i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid  keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts   he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys  whole arm   what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his  hands together id not say no ter summat stronger if  yehve got it mind   his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled  chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the  fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but  when he drew back a second later there was a  roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with  flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over  him as though hed sunk into a hot bath            the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged  under his weight and began taking all sorts of things  out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a  squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot  several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber  liquid that he took a swig from before starting to  make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and  smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while  the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat  juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley  fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont  touch anything he gives you dudley   the giant chuckled darkly   yer great puddin of a son don need fattenin  anymore dursley don worry   he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry  he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he  still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as  nobody seemed about to explain anything he said  im sorry but i still dont really know who you are   the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with  the back of his hand   call me hagrid he said everyone does an like i  told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts   yehll  know all about hogwarts o course   er   no said harry   hagrid looked shocked   sorry harry said quickly   sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the  dursleys who shrank back into the shadows its          them as should be sorry i knew yeh werent gettin  yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldnt even  know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud did yeh  never wonder where yer parents learned it all   all what asked harry   all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one  second   he had leapt to his feet in his anger he seemed to fill  the whole hut the dursleys were cowering against  the wall   do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys  that this boy   this boy   knows nothin abou    about anything   harry thought this was going a bit far he had been to  school after all and his marks werent bad   i know some things he said i can you know do  math and stuff   but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about  our world i mean your world my world yer parents  world   what world   hagrid looked as if he was about to explode  dursley he boomed   uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered  something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid  stared wildly at harry            but yeh must know about yer mom and dad he  said i mean theyre famous youre famous   what my   my mom and dad werent famous were  they   yeh don know  yeh don know  hagrid ran his  fingers through his hair fixing harry with a  bewildered stare   yeh don know what yeh are he said finally   uncle vernon suddenly found his voice   stop he commanded stop right there sir i forbid  you to tell the boy anything   a braver man than vernon dursley would have  quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him  when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with  rage   you never told him never told him what was in the  letter dumbledore left fer him i was there i saw  dumbledore leave it dursley an youve kept it from  him all these years   kept what from me said harry eagerly   stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic   aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror   ah go boil yer heads both of yeh said hagrid  harry   yer a wizard   there was silence inside the hut only the sea and  the whistling wind could be heard            im a what gasped harry     a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down  on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an  a thumpin goodun id say once yehve been trained  up a bit with a mum an dad like yours what else  would yeh be an i reckon its abou time yeh read  yer letter   harry stretched out his hand at last to take the  yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr  h potter the floor hutontherock the sea he  pulled out the letter and read   hogwarts school  owitchcraft and wizardry   headmaster albus dumbledore   order of merlin first class grand sore chf   warlock supreme mugwump international confed of  wizards   dear mr potter   we are pleased to inform you that you have been  accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and  wizardry please find enclosed a list of all necessary  books and equipment   term begins on september  we await your owl by no  later than july    yours sincerely   minerva mcgonagall   deputy headmistress            questions exploded inside harrys head like fireworks  and he couldnt decide which to ask first after a few  minutes he stammered what does it mean they  await my owl   gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid  clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to  knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket  inside his overcoat he pulled an owl   a real live  rather ruffledlooking owl   a long quill and a roll of  parchment with his tongue between his teeth he  scribbled a note that harry could read upside down   dear professor dumbledore   given harry his letter   taking him to buy his things tomorrow   weathers horrible hope youre well   hagrid   hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which  clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw  the owl out into the storm then he came back and  sat down as though this was as normal as talking on  the telephone   harry realized his mouth was open and closed it  quickly   where was i said hagrid but at that moment   uncle vernon still ashenfaced but looking very  angry moved into the firelight   hes not going he said   hagrid grunted          id like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he  said     a what said harry interested   a muggle said hagrid its what we call nonmagic  folk like them an its your bad luck you grew up in a  family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on   we swore when we took him in wed put a stop to  that rubbish said uncle vernon swore wed stamp  it out of him wizard indeed   you knew said harry you knew im a   a  wizard   knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew of  course we knew how could you not be my dratted  sister being what she was oh she got a letter just  like that and disappeared off to that   that school    and came home every vacation with her pockets full  of frog spawn turning teacups into rats i was the  only one who saw her for what she was   a freak   but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this  and lily that they were proud of having a witch in  the family   she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went  ranting on it seemed she had been wanting to say all  this for years   then she met that potter at school and they left and  got married and had you and of course i knew youd  be just the same just as strange just as   as    abnormal   and then if you please she went and got  herself blown up and we got landed with you            harry had gone very white as soon as he found his  voice he said blown up you told me they died in a  car crash   car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily  that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how  could a car crash kill lily an james potter its an  outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own  story when every kid in our world knows his name   but why what happened harry asked urgently   the anger faded from hagrids face he looked  suddenly anxious   i never expected this he said in a low worried  voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there  might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh  didnt know ah harry i don know if im the right  person ter tell yeh   but someones gotta   yeh cant  go off ter hogwarts not knowin   he threw a dirty look at the dursleys   well its best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh    mind i cant tell yeh everythin its a great mystry  parts of it    he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds  and then said it begins i suppose with   with a  person called   but its incredible yeh dont know his  name everyone in our world knows      who   well   i don like sayin the name if i can help it no  one does   why not          gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared  blimey this is difficult see there was this wizard  who went  bad as bad as you could go worse  worse than worse his name was    hagrid gulped but no words came out   could you write it down harry suggested   nah   cant spell it all right   voldemort hagrid  shuddered don make me say it again anyway this    this wizard about twenty years ago now started  lookin fer followers got em too   some were afraid  some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was  gettin himself power all right dark days harry  didnt know who ter trust didnt dare get friendly  with strange wizards or witches    terrible things  happened he was takin over course some stood up  to him   an he killed em horribly one o the only  safe places left was hogwarts reckon dumbledores  the only one youknowwho was afraid of didnt dare  try takin the school not jus then anyway   now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an  wizard as i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts  in their day suppose the mystry is why youknow  who never tried to get em on his side before     probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter  want anythin ter do with the dark side   maybe he thought he could persuade em  maybe  he just wanted em outta the way all anyone knows  is he turned up in the village where you was all  living on halloween ten years ago you was just a  year old he came ter yer house an   an      hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted  handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a  foghorn          sorry he said but its that sad   knew yer mum  an dad an nicer people yeh couldnt find   anyway     youknowwho killed em an then   an this is the  real mystry of the thing   he tried to kill you too  wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or  maybe he just liked killin by then but he couldnt do  it never wondered how you got that mark on yer  forehead that was no ordinary cut thats what yeh  get when a powerful evil curse touches yeh   took  care of yer mum an dad an yer house even   but it  didnt work on you an thats why yer famous harry  no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one  except you an hed killed some o the best witches  an wizards of the age   the mckinnons the bones  the prewetts   an you was only a baby an you  lived   something very painful was going on in harrys mind  as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the  blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had  ever remembered it before   and he remembered  something else for the first time in his life a high  cold cruel laugh   hagrid was watching him sadly   took yeh from the ruined house myself on  dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot    load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped  he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there  uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his  courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were  clenched   now you listen here boy he snarled i accept  theres something strange about you probably          nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured   and as  for all this about your parents well they were  weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off  without them in my opinion   asked for all they got  getting mixed up with these wizarding types   just  what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky  end      but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and  drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat  pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said  im warning you dursley   im warning you   one  more word    in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella  by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed  again he flattened himself against the wall and fell  silent   thats better said hagrid breathing heavily and  sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged  right down to the floor   harry meanwhile still had questions to ask  hundreds of them   but what happened to vol sorry   i mean you  knowwho   good question harry disappeared vanished same  night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more  famous thats the biggest mystry see  he was  gettin more an more powerful   whyd he go   some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno  if he had enough human left in him to die some say  hes still out there bidin his time like but i don  believe it people who was on his side came back ter            ours some of em came outta kinda trances don  reckon they couldve done if he was cornin back   most of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but  lost his powers too weak to carry on cause  somethin about you finished him harry there was  somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on     dunno what it was no one does   but somethin  about you stumped him all right   hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect  blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling  pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a  horrible mistake a wizard him how could he  possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by  dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle  vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they  been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried  to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the  greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had  always been able to kick him around like a football   hagrid he said quietly i think you must have  made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizard   to his surprise hagrid chuckled   not a wizard eh never made things happen when  you was scared or angry   harry looked into the fire now he came to think  about it    every odd thing that had ever made his  aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when  he harry had been upset or angry  chased by  dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of  their reach    dreading going to school with that  ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow  back    and the very last time dudley had hit him            hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he  was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him     harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that  hagrid was positively beaming at him   see said hagrid harry potter not a wizard   you  wait youll be right famous at hogwarts   but uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a  fight   havent i told you hes not going he hissed hes  going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive  read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish    spell books and wands and      if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop  him growled hagrid stop lily an james potters  son goin ter hogwarts yer mad his names been  down ever since he was born hes off ter the finest  school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world seven  years there and he wont know himself hell be with  youngsters of his own sort fer a change an hell be  under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had  albus dumbled      i am not paying for some crackpot old  fool to teach him magic tricks yelled uncle  vernon   but he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his  umbrella and whirled it over his head never    he  thundered   insult   albus   dumbledore    in   front   of   me   he brought the umbrella swishing down through the  air to point at dudley   there was a flash of violet  light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and          the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with  his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in  pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a  curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousers   uncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and  dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified  look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them   hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his  beard   shouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it  didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig  but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there  wasnt much left ter do   he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy  eyebrows   be grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at  hogwarts he said im   er   not supposed ter do  magic strictly speakin i was allowed ter do a bit ter  follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff   one o  the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job      why arent you supposed to do magic asked harry   oh well   i was at hogwarts meself but i   er    got expelled ter tell yeh the truth in me third year  they snapped me wand in half an everything but  dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper great  man dumbledore   why were you expelled   its gettin late and weve got lots ter do tomorrow  said hagrid loudly gotta get up ter town get all yer  books an that          he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry     you can kip under that he said don mind if it  wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in  one o the pockets             diagon ally   harry woke early the next morning although he  could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight   it was a dream he told himself firmly i dreamed a  giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a  school for wizards when i open my eyes ill be at  home in my cupboard   there was suddenly a loud tapping noise   and theres aunt petunia knocking on the door harry  thought his heart sinking but he still didnt open his  eyes it had been such a good dream   tap tap tap   all right harry mumbled im getting up   he sat up and hagrid s heavy coat fell off him the  hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid  himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there           was an owl rapping its claw on the window a  newspaper held in its beak   harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as  though a large balloon was swelling inside him he  went straight to the window and jerked it open the  owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of  hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered  onto the floor and began to attack hagrid s coat   dont do that   harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it  snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on  savaging the coat   hagrid said harry loudly theres an owl      pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa   what   he wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the  pockets   hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but  pockets   bunches of keys slug pellets balls of  string peppermint humbugs teabags  finally harry  pulled out a handful of strangelooking coins   give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily   knuts   the little bronze ones   harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl  held out his leg so harry could put the money into a            small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off  through the open window   hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched   best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter  london an buy all yer stuff fer school   harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking  at them he had just thought of something that made  him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had  got a puncture   urn   hagrid   mm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge  boots   i havent got any money   and you heard uncle  vernon last night  he wont pay for me to go and  learn magic   dont worry about that said hagrid standing up  and scratching his head dyeh think yer parents  didnt leave yeh anything   but if their house was destroyed      they didn keep their gold in the house boy nah  first stop fer us is gringotts wizards bank have a  sausage theyre not bad cold   an i wouldn say no  teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither   wizards have banks   just the one gringotts run by goblins   harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding            goblins     yeah   so yehd be mad ter try an rob it ill tell yeh  that never mess with goblins harry gringotts is the  safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter  keep safe   cept maybe hogwarts as a matter o  fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore  hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly  he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him  fetchin you   gettin things from gringotts   knows  he can trust me see   got everythin come on then   harry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was  quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight  the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with  a lot of water in the bottom after the storm   how did you get here harry asked looking around  for another boat   flew said hagrid   flew   yeah   but well go back in this not spposed ter  use magic now ive got yeh   they settled down in the boat harry still staring at  hagrid trying to imagine him flying   seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving  harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter   er    speed things up a bit would yeh mind not  mentionin it at hogwarts   of course not said harry eager to see more magic  hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it          twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward  land   why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts  harry asked   spells   enchantments said hagrid unfolding his  newspaper as he spoke they say theres dragons  guardin the highsecurity vaults and then yeh gotta  find yer way   gringotts is hundreds of miles under  london see deep under the underground yehd die  of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter  get yer hands on summat   harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read  his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned  from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone  while they did this but it was very difficult hed  never had so many questions in his life   ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid  muttered turning the page   theres a ministry of magic harry asked before he  could stop himself    course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer  minister o course but hed never leave hogwarts so  old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there  was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every  morning askin fer advice   but what does a ministry of magic do   well their main job is to keep it from the muggles  that theres still witches an wizards up an down the  country   why          why blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic  solutions to their problems nah were best left  alone   at this moment the boat bumped gently into the  harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and  they clambered up the stone steps onto the street   passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked  through the little town to the station harry couldnt  blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as  anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary  things like parking meters and saying loudly see  that harry things these muggles dream up eh   hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep  up did you say there are dragons at gringotts   well so they say said hagrid crikey id like a  dragon   youd like one   wanted one ever since i was a kid   here we go   they had reached the station there was a train to  london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt  understand muggle money as he called it gave the  bills to harry so he could buy their tickets   people stared more than ever on the train hagrid  took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a  canaryyellow circus tent   still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted  stitches   harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket            good said hagrid theres a list there of everything  yeh need     harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt  noticed the night before and read   hogwarts school  owitchcraft and wizardry   uniform     firstyear students will require

allowed their own broomsticks   can we buy all this in london harry wondered  aloud   if yeh know where to go said hagrid   harry had never been to london before although  hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was  obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary  way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the  underground and complained loudly that the seats  were too small and the trains too slow          i dont know how the muggles manage without  magic he said as they climbed a brokendown  escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with  shops   hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily  all harry had to do was keep close behind him they  passed book shops and music stores hamburger  restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as  if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an  ordinary street full of ordinary people could there  really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath  them were there really shops that sold spell books  and broomsticks might this not all be some huge  joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt  known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he  might have thought so yet somehow even though  everything hagrid had told him so far was  unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting him   this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky  cauldron its a famous place   it was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt  pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was  there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their  eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the  record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the  leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most  peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it  before he could mention this hagrid had steered him  inside   for a famous place it was very dark and shabby a  few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny  glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long  pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old  bartender who was quite bald and looked like a  toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped         when they walked in everyone seemed to know  hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the  bartender reached for a glass saying the usual  hagrid   cant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid  clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and  making harrys knees buckle   good lord said the bartender peering at harry is  this   can this be      the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely  still and silent   bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry  potter  what an honor   he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward  harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes   welcome back mr potter welcome back   harry didnt know what to say everyone was looking  at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it  without realizing it had gone out hagrid was  beaming   then there was a great scraping of chairs and the  next moment harry found himself shaking hands  with everyone in the leaky cauldron   doris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting  you at last   so proud mr potter im just so proud   always wanted to shake your hand   im all of a  flutter          delighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the  name dedalus diggle   ive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles  top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me  once in a shop   he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking  around at everyone did you hear that he  remembers me   harry shook hands again and again   doris  crockford kept coming back for more   a pale young man made his way forward very  nervously one of his eyes was twitching   professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor  quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts   pppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping  harrys hand ccant ttell you how ppleased i am to  meet you   what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell   ddefense against the dddark arts muttered  professor quirrell as though hed rather not think  about it nnot that you nneed it eh pppotter   he laughed nervously youll be ggetting all your  equipment i suppose ive ggot to ppick up a new b  book on vampires mmyself he looked terrified at  the very thought   but the others wouldnt let professor quirrell keep  harry to himself it took almost ten minutes to get  away from them all at last hagrid managed to make  himself heard over the babble            must get on   lots ter buy come on harry   doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time  and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a  small walled courtyard where there was nothing but  a trash can and a few weeds   hagrid grinned at harry   told yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even  professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh   mind  you hes usually tremblin   is he always that nervous   oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine  while he was studyin outta books but then he took a  year off ter get some firsthand experience  they say  he met vampires in the black forest and there was a  nasty bit o trouble with a hag   never been the same  since scared of the students scared of his own  subject   now wheres me umbrella   vampires hags harrys head was swimming   hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall  above the trash can   three up  two across  he muttered right  stand back harry   he tapped the wall three times with the point of his  umbrella   the brick he had touched quivered   it wriggled   in  the middle a small hole appeared   it grew wider  and wider   a second later they were facing an  archway large enough even for hagrid an archway  onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of  sight          welcome said hagrid to diagon alley   he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped  through the archway harry looked quickly over his  shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back  into solid wall   the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons  outside the nearest shop cauldrons   all sizes    copper brass pewter silver   selfstirring    collapsible said a sign hanging over them   yeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we  gotta get yer money first   harry wished he had about eight more eyes he  turned his head in every direction as they walked up  the street trying to look at everything at once the  shops the things outside them the people doing their  shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary  was shaking her head as they passed saying   dragon liver sixteen sickles an ounce theyre mad   a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign  saying eeylops owl emporium   tawny screech  barn brown and snowy several boys of about  harrys age had their noses pressed against a window  with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of  them say the new nimbus two thousand   fastest  ever    there were shops selling robes shops selling  telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had  never seen before windows stacked with barrels of  bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell  books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles  globes of the moon    gringotts said hagrid            they had reached a snowy white building that  towered over the other little shops standing beside  its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of  scarlet and gold was     yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they  walked up the white stone steps toward him the  goblin was about a head shorter than harry he had a  swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry  noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they  walked inside now they were facing a second pair of  doors silver this time with words engraved upon  them   enter stranger but take heed   of what awaits the sin of greed   for those who take but do not earn   must pay most dearly in their turn   so if you seek beneath our floors   a treasure that was never yours   thief you have been warned beware   of finding more than treasure there   like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said  hagrid   a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors  and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred  more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long  counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in  brass scales examining precious stones through  eyeglasses there were too many doors to count         leading off the hall and yet more goblins were  showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry  made for the counter   morning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come  ter take some money outta mr harry potters safe   you have his key sir   got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started  emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a  handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of  numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry  watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of  rubies as big as glowing coals   got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden  key   the goblin looked at it closely   that seems to be in order   an ive also got a letter here from professor  dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out  his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault  seven hundred and thirteen   the goblin read the letter carefully   very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will  have someone take you down to both vaults  griphook   griphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had  crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets  he and harry followed griphook toward one of the  doors leading off the hall            whats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred  and thirteen harry asked   cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very  secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me  moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that   griphook held the door open for them harry who  had expected more marble was surprised they were  in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming  torches it sloped steeply downward and there were  little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled  and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward  them they climbed in   hagrid with some difficulty    and were off   at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting  passages harry tried to remember left right right  left middle fork right left but it was impossible the  rattling cart seemed to know its own way because  griphook wasnt steering   harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them  but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw  a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted  around to see if it was a dragon but too late   they  plunged even deeper passing an underground lake  where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the  ceiling and floor   i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise  of the cart whats the difference between a  stalagmite and a stalactite   stalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don  ask me questions just now i think im gonna be  sick            he did look very green and when the cart stopped at  last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid  got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his  knees from trembling   griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke  came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped  inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver  heaps of little bronze knuts   all yours smiled hagrid   all harrys   it was incredible the dursleys couldnt  have known about this or theyd have had it from him  faster than blinking how often had they complained  how much harry cost them to keep and all the time  there had been a small fortune belonging to him  buried deep under london   hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag   the gold ones are galleons he explained   seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine  knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should  be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest  safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven  hundred and thirteen now please and can we go  more slowly   one speed only said griphook   they were going even deeper now and gathering  speed the air became colder and colder as they  hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over  an underground ravine and harry leaned over the  side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom  but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff  of his neck            vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole   stand back said griphook importantly he stroked  the door gently with one of his long fingers and it  simply melted away   if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be  sucked through the door and trapped in there said  griphook   how often do you check to see if anyones inside  harry asked   about once every ten years said griphook with a  rather nasty grin   something really extraordinary had to be inside this  top security vault harry was sure and he leaned  forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at  the very least   but at first he thought it was empty  then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up  in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up  and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to  know what it was but knew better than to ask   come on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to  me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth  shut said hagrid     one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the  sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where  to run first now that he had a bag full of money he  didnt have to know how many galleons there were to  a pound to know that he was holding more money  than hed had in his whole life   more money than  even dudley had ever had            might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding  toward madam malkins robes for all occasions  listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a  pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them  gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry  entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous   madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all  in mauve   hogwarts dear she said when harry started to  speak got the lot here   another young man being  fitted up just now in fact   in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed  face was standing on a footstool while a second witch  pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood  harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over  his head and began to pin it to the right length   hello said the boy hogwarts too   yes said harry   my fathers next door buying my books and mothers  up the street looking at wands said the boy he had  a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them  off to look at racing brooms i dont see why first years  cant have their own i think ill bully father into  getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehow   harry was strongly reminded of dudley   have you got your own broom the boy went on   no said harry   play quidditch at all            no harry said again wondering what on earth  quidditch could be    i do   father says its a crime if im not picked to  play for my house and i must say i agree know  what house you  be in yet   no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute   well no one really knows until they get there do  they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family  have been   imagine being in hufflepuff i think id  leave wouldnt you   mmm said harry wishing he could say something a  bit more interesting   i say look at that man said the boy suddenly  nodding toward the front window hagrid was  standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two  large ice creams to show he couldnt come in   thats hagrid said harry pleased to know  something the boy didnt he works at hogwarts   oh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of  servant isnt he   hes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the  boy less and less every second   yes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage   lives in a  hut on the school grounds and every now and then he  gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire  to his bed   i think hes brilliant said harry coldly            do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he  with you where are your parents   theyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel  much like going into the matter with this boy   oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all  but they were our kind werent they   they were a witch and wizard if thats what you  mean   i really dont think they should let the other sort in  do you theyre just not the same theyve never been  brought up to know our ways some of them have  never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter  imagine i think they should keep it in the old  wizarding families whats your surname anyway   but before harry could answer madam malkin said  thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for  an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down  from the footstool   well ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the  drawling boy   harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid  had bought him chocolate and raspberry with  chopped nuts   whats up said hagrid   nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment  and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a  bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when  they had left the shop he said hagrid whats  quidditch            blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know    not knowin about quidditch   dont make me feel worse said harry he told  hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkins      and he said people from muggle families shouldnt  even be allowed in      yer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh  were   hes grown up knowin yer name if his  parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in  the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh  anyway what does he know about it some o the best  i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a  long line o muggles   look at yer mum look what  she had fer a sister   so what is quidditch   its our sport wizard sport its like   like soccer in  the muggle world   everyone follows quidditch    played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four  balls   sorta hard ter explain the rules   and what are slytherin and hufflepuff   school houses theres four everyone says  hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but      i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomily   better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly  theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad  who wasnt in slytherin youknowwho was one   vol sorry   youknowwho was at hogwarts   years an years ago said hagrid          they bought harrys school books in a shop called  flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to  the ceiling with books as large as paving stones  bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in  covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a  few books with nothing in them at all even dudley  who never read anything would have been wild to get  his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to  drag harry away from curses and countercurses  bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies  with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs  tonguetying and much much more by professor  vindictus viridian   i was trying to find out how to curse dudley   im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter  use magic in the muggle world except in very special  circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh  couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot  more study before yeh get ter that level   hagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron  either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice  set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a  collapsible brass telescope then they visited the  apothecary which was fascinating enough to make  up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and  rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the  floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders  lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs  and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while  hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a  supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry  harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at  twentyone galleons each and minuscule glittery  black beetle eyes five knuts a scoop            outside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list  again   just yer wand left   oh yeah an i still havent got  yeh a birthday present   harry felt himself go red   you dont have to      i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer  animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years  ago yehd be laughed at   an i don like cats they  make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want  owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an  everythin   twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl  emporium which had been dark and full of rustling  and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a  large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep  with her head under her wing he couldnt stop  stammering his thanks sounding just like professor  quirrell   don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect  youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just  ollivanders left now   only place fer wands  ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand   a magic wand    this was what harry had been really  looking forward to   the last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold  letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine  wands since b c a single wand lay on a faded  purple cushion in the dusty window            a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the  shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place  empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid  sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had  entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new  questions that had just occurred to him and looked  instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly  right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of  his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here  seemed to tingle with some secret magic   good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped  hagrid must have jumped too because there was a  loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the  spindly chair   an old man was standing before them his wide pale  eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the  shop   hello said harry awkwardly   ah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be  seeing you soon harry potter it wasnt a question  you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday  she was in here herself buying her first wand ten  and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow  nice wand for charm work   mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished  he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepy   your father on the other hand favored a mahogany  wand eleven inches pliable a little more power and  excellent for transfiguration well i say your father  favored it   its really the wand that chooses the  wizard of course            mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry  were almost nose to nose harry could see himself  reflected in those misty eyes   and thats where    mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys  forehead with a long white finger   im sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said  softly thirteenandahalf inches yew powerful  wand very powerful and in the wrong hands  well  if id known what that wand was going out into the  world to do    he shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted  hagrid   rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again    oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt it   it was sir yes said hagrid   good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it  in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander  suddenly stern   er   yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his  feet ive still got the pieces though he added  brightly   but you dont use them said mr ollivander  sharply   oh no sir said hagrid quickly harry noticed he  gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke   hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a  piercing look well now   mr potter let me see          he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings  out of his pocket which is your wand arm   er   well im righthanded said harry   hold out your arm thats it he measured harry  from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder  to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he  measured he said every ollivander wand has a core  of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use  unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the  heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are  the same just as no two unicorns dragons or  phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will  never get such good results with another wizards  wand   harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which  was measuring between his nostrils was doing this  on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the  shelves taking down boxes   that will do he said and the tape measure  crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr  potter try this one beechwood and dragon  heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take  it and give it a wave   harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it  around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his  hand almost at once   maple and phoenix feather seven inches quite  whippy try      harry tried   but he had hardly raised the wand  when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander            no no   here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a  half inches springy go on go on try it out   harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr  ollivander was waiting for the pile of tried wands  was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair  but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the  shelves the happier he seemed to become   tricky customer eh not to worry well find the  perfect match here somewhere   i wonder now    yes why not   unusual combination   holly and  phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple   harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his  fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it  swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of  red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework  throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid  whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh  bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well   how curious  how very curious    he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it  in brown paper still muttering curious    curious     sorry said harry but whats curious   mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare   i remember every wand ive ever sold mr potter  every single wand it so happens that the phoenix  whose tail feather is in your wand gave another  feather   just one other it is very curious indeed  that you should be destined for this wand when its  brother   why its brother gave you that scar     harry swallowed          yes thirteenandahalf inches yew curious indeed  how these things happen the wand chooses the  wizard remember  i think we must expect great  things from you mr potter  after all hewho  mustnotbenamed did great things   terrible yes  but great   harry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr   ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for  his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his  shop   the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry  and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley  back through the wall back through the leaky  cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as  they walked down the road he didnt even notice how  much people were gawking at them on the  underground laden as they were with all their funny  shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its  cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into  paddington station harry only realized where they  were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder   got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he  said   he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on  plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around  everything looked so strange somehow   you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid   harry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the  best birthday of his life   and yet   he chewed his  hamburger trying to find the words   everyone thinks im special he said at last all  those people in the leaky cauldron professor          quirrell mr ollivander  but i dont know anything  about magic at all how can they expect great things  im famous and i cant even remember what im  famous for i dont know what happened when vol  sorry   i mean the night my parents died   hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard  and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile   don you worry harry youll learn fast enough  everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll  be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve  been singled out an thats always hard but yehll  have a great time at hogwarts   i did   still do  smatter of fact   hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take  him back to the dursleys then handed him an  envelope   yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september    kings cross   its all on yer ticket any problems  with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell  know where to find me  see yeh soon harry   the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to  watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his  seat and pressed his nose against the window but he  blinked and hagrid had gone               the journey from platform  nine and threequarters   harrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun  true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt  stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle  vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him  to do anything or shout at him   in fact they didnt  speak to him at all half terrified half furious they  acted as though any chair with harry in it were  empty although this was an improvement in many  ways it did become a bit depressing after a while   harry kept to his room with his new owl for  company he had decided to call her hedwig a name  he had found in a history of magic his school books  were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late  into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the  open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt  petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because  hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night  before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day           on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall  counting down to september the first   on the last day of august he thought hed better  speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings  cross station the next day so he went down to the  living room where they were watching a quiz show on  television he cleared his throat to let them know he  was there and dudley screamed and ran from the  room   er   uncle vernon   uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening   er   i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to   to  go to hogwarts   uncle vernon grunted again   would it be all right if you gave me a lift   grunt harry supposed that meant yes   thank you   he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon  actually spoke   funny way to get to a wizards school the train  magic carpets all got punctures have they   harry didnt say anything   where is this school anyway   i dont know said harry realizing this for the first  time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of  his pocket          i just take the train from platform nine and three  quarters at eleven oclock he read   his aunt and uncle stared   platform what   nine and threequarters   dont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no  platform nine and threequarters   its on my ticket   barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of  them you  see you just wait all right well take  you to kings cross were going up to london  tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt bother   why are you going to london harry asked trying  to keep things friendly   taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle  vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before  he goes to smeltings   harry woke at five oclock the next morning and was  too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up  and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to  walk into the station in his wizards robes   hed  change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet  again to make sure he had everything he needed saw  that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then  paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up  two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been  loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had  talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had  set off            they reached kings cross at half past ten uncle  vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and  wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this  was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead  facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face   well there you are boy platform nine   platform  ten your platform should be somewhere in the  middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do  they   he was quite right of course there was a big plastic  number nine over one platform and a big plastic  number ten over the one next to it and in the middle  nothing at all   have a good term said uncle vernon with an even  nastier smile he left without another word harry  turned and saw the dursleys drive away all three of  them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry  what on earth was he going to do he was starting to  attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed  have to ask someone   he stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention  platform nine and threequarters the guard had  never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt  even tell him what part of the country it was in he  started to get annoyed as though harry was being  stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for  the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said  there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away  muttering about time wasters harry was now trying  hard not to panic according to the large clock over  the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on  the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it  he was stranded in the middle of a station with a  trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard  money and a large owl          hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you  had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to  get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get  out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors  stand between platforms nine and ten   at that moment a group of people passed just behind  him and he caught a few words of what they were  saying      packed with muggles of course      harry swung round the speaker was a plump  woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming  red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like  harrys in front of him   and they had an owl   heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them  they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear  what they were saying   now whats the platform number said the boys  mother   nine and threequarters piped a small girl also red  headed who was holding her hand mom cant i go     youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right  percy you go first   what looked like the oldest boy marched toward  platforms nine and ten harry watched careful not to  blink in case he missed it   but just as the boy  reached the dividing barrier between the two  platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in  front of him and by the time the last backpack had  cleared away the boy had vanished            fred you next the plump woman said     im not fred im george said the boy honestly  woman you call yourself our mother cant you tell  im george   sorry george dear   only joking i am fred said the boy and off he  went his twin called after him to hurry up and he  must have done so because a second later he had  gone   but how had he done it   now the third brother was walking briskly toward the  barrier   he was almost there   and then quite  suddenly he wasnt anywhere   there was nothing else for it   excuse me harry said to the plump woman   hello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons  new too   she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he  was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands  and feet and a long nose   yes said harry the thing is   the thing is i dont  know how to      how to get onto the platform she said kindly and  harry nodded   not to worry she said all you have to do is walk  straight at the barrier between platforms nine and  ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into  it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if  youre nervous go on go now before ron          er   okay said harry   he pushed his trolley around and stared at the  barrier it looked very solid   he started to walk toward it people jostled him on  their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked  more quickly he was going to smash right into that  barrier and then hed be in trouble   leaning forward  on his cart he broke into a heavy run   the barrier  was coming nearer and nearer   he wouldnt be able  to stop   the cart was out of control   he was a foot  away   he closed his eyes ready for the crash     it didnt come  he kept on running  he opened his  eyes   a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform  packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts  express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and  saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had  been with the words platform nine and three  quarters on it he had done it   smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the  chattering crowd while cats of every color wound  here and there between their legs owls hooted to one  another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble  and the scraping of heavy trunks   the first few carriages were already packed with  students some hanging out of the window to talk to  their families some fighting over seats harry pushed  his cart off down the platform in search of an empty  seat he passed a roundfaced boy who was saying  gran ive lost my toad again   oh neville he heard the old woman sigh            a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small  crowd     give us a look lee go on   the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the  people around him shrieked and yelled as something  inside poked out a long hairy leg   harry pressed on through the crowd until he found  an empty compartment near the end of the train he  put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and  heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift  it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and  twice he dropped it painfully on his foot   want a hand it was one of the redhaired twins  hed followed through the barrier   yes please harry panted   oy fred cmere and help   with the twins help harrys trunk was at last tucked  away in a corner of the compartment   thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of  his eyes   whats that said one of the twins suddenly  pointing at harrys lightning scar   blimey said the other twin are you      he is said the first twin arent you he added to  harry   what said harry           harry potter chorused the twins   oh him said harry i mean yes i am   the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself  turning red then to his relief a voice came floating  in through the trains open door   fred george are you there   coming mom   with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the  train   harry sat down next to the window where half  hidden he could watch the redhaired family on the  platform and hear what they were saying their  mother had just taken out her handkerchief   ron youve got something on your nose   the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she  grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose   mom   geroff he wriggled free   aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie  said one of the twins   shut up said ron   wheres percy said their mother   hes coming now   the oldest boy came striding into sight he had  already changed into his billowing black hogwarts            robes and harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge  on his chest with the letter p on it   cant stay long mother he said im up front the  prefects have got two compartments to themselves      oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins  with an air of great surprise you should have said  something we had no idea   hang on i think i remember him saying something  about

said their mother fondly all  right dear well have a good term   send me an owl  when you get there   she kissed percy on the cheek and he left then she  turned to the twins   now you two   this year

and look after ron   dont worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us   shut up said ron again he was almost as tall as  the twins already and his nose was still pink where  his mother had rubbed it   hey mom guess what guess who we just met on  the train   harry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him  looking   you know that blackhaired boy who was near us in  the station know who he is   who    harry potted   harry heard the little girls voice   oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom  oh please    youve already seen him ginny and the poor boy  isnt something you goggle at in a zoo is he really  fred how do you know   asked him saw his scar its really there   like  lightning   poor dear   no wonder he was alone i wondered he  was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the  platform   never mind that do you think he remembers what  youknowwho looks like          their mother suddenly became very stern     i forbid you to ask him fred no dont you dare as  though he needs reminding of that on his first day at  school   all right keep your hair on   a whistle sounded   hurry up their mother said and the three boys  clambered onto the train they leaned out of the  window for her to kiss them goodbye and their  younger sister began to cry   dont ginny well send you loads of owls   well send you a hogwarts toilet seat    georg e   only joking mom   the train began to move harry saw the boys mother  waving and their sister half laughing half crying  running to keep up with the train until it gathered too  much speed then she fell back and waved   harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as  the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the  window harry felt a great leap of excitement he  didnt know what he was going to   but it had to be  better than what he was leaving behind   the door of the compartment slid open and the  youngest redheaded boy came in   anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat  opposite harry everywhere else is full          harry shook his head and the boy sat down he  glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the  window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he  still had a black mark on his nose   hey ron   the twins were back   listen were going down the middle of the train     lee jordans got a giant tarantula down there   right mumbled ron   harry said the other twin did we introduce  ourselves fred and george weasley and this is ron  our brother see you later then   bye said harry and ron the twins slid the  compartment door shut behind them   are you really harry potter ron blurted out   harry nodded   oh   well i thought it might be one of fred and  georges jokes said ron and have you really got    you know    he pointed at harrys forehead   harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning  scar ron stared   so thats where youknowwho      yes said harry but i cant remember it   nothing said ron eagerly          well   i remember a lot of green light but nothing  else     wow said ron he sat and stared at harry for a few  moments then as though he had suddenly realized  what he was doing he looked quickly out of the  window again   are all your family wizards asked harry who found  ron just as interesting as ron found him   er   yes i think so said ron i think moms got a  second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk  about him   so you must know loads of magic already   the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding  families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked  about   i heard you went to live with muggles said ron  what are they like   horrible   well not all of them my aunt and uncle  and cousin are though wish id had three wizard  brothers   five said ron for some reason he was looking  gloomy im the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts  you could say ive got a lot to live up to bill and  charlie have already left   bill was head boy and  charlie was captain of quidditch now percys a  prefect fred and george mess around a lot but they  still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyre  really funny everyone expects me to do as well as the  others but if i do its no big deal because they did it  first you never get anything new either with five          brothers ive got bills old robes charlies old wand  and percys old rat   ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat  gray rat which was asleep   his names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever  wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being  made a prefect but they couldnt aff   i mean i got  scabbers instead   rons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said  too much because he went back to staring out of the  window   harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not  being able to afford an owl after all hed never had  any money in his life until a month ago and he told  ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes  and never getting proper birthday presents this  seemed to cheer ron up    and until hagrid told me i didnt know anything  about being a wizard or about my parents or  voldemort      ron gasped   what said harry    you said youknowwhos name said ron sounding  both shocked and impressed id have thought you  of all people      im not trying to be brave or anything saying the  name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt  see what i mean ive got loads to learn  i bet he  added voicing for the first time something that had            been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in  the class   you wont be theres loads of people who come from  muggle families and they learn quick enough   while they had been talking the train had carried  them out of london now they were speeding past  fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a  time watching the fields and lanes flick past   around half past twelve there was a great clattering  outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman  slid back their door and said anything off the cart  dears   harry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet  but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that  hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the  corridor   he had never had any money for candy with the  dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with  gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars  bars as he could carry   but the woman didnt have  mars bars what she did have were bertie botts  every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum  chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes  licorice wands and a number of other strange things  harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss  anything he got some of everything and paid the  woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts   ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the  compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat   hungry are you            starving said harry taking a large bite out of a  pumpkin pasty   ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped  it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one  of them apart and said she always forgets i dont  like corned beef   swap you for one of these said harry holding up a  pasty go on      you dont want this its all dry said ron she  hasnt got much time he added quickly you know  with five of us   go on have a pasty said harry who had never had  anything to share before or indeed anyone to share  it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron  eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes  and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten   what are these harry asked ron holding up a  pack of chocolate frogs theyre not really frogs are  they he was starting to feel that nothing would  surprise him   no said ron but see what the card is im missing  agrippa   what   oh of course you wouldnt know   chocolate frogs  have cards inside them you know to collect    famous witches and wizards ive got about five  hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemy   harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up  the card it showed a mans face he wore halfmoon  glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver          hair beard and mustache underneath the picture  was the name albus dumbledore     so this is dumbledore said harry   dont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said  ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa   thanks     harry turned over his card and read   albus dumbledore   currently headmaster of hogwarts   considered by many the greatest wizard of modern  times dumbledore is particularly famous for his  defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the  discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his  work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel  professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten  pin bowling   harry turned the card back over and saw to his  astonishment that dumbledore s face had  disappeared   hes gone   well you cant expect him to hang around all day  said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again  and ive got about six of her  do you want it you  can start collecting   rons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs  waiting to be unwrapped   help yourself said harry but in you know the  muggle world people just stay put in photos          do they what they dont move at all ron sounded  amazed weird     harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the  picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron  was more interested in eating the frogs than looking  at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry  couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only  dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcraft  alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin he  finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna  who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie  botts every flavor beans   you want to be careful with those ron warned  harry when they say every flavor they mean every  flavor   you know you get all the ordinary ones like  chocolate and peppermint and marmalade but then  you can get spinach and liver and tripe george  reckons he had a boogerflavored one once   ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully  and bit into a corner   bleaaargh   see sprouts   they had a good time eating the every flavor beans  harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry  curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave  enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron  wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepper   the countryside now flying past the window was  becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there  were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills   there was a knock on the door of their compartment  and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on          platform nine and threequarters came in he looked  tearful     sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all   when they shook their heads he wailed ive lost  him he keeps getting away from me   hell turn up said harry   yes said the boy miserably well if you see him   he left   dont know why hes so bothered said ron if id  brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind  you i brought scabbers so i cant talk   the rat was still snoozing on rons lap   he might have died and you wouldnt know the  difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him  yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but  the spell didnt work ill show you look    he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a  very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places  and something white was glinting at the end   unicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway      he had just raised his wand when the compartment  door slid open again the toadless boy was back but  this time he had a girl with him she was already  wearing her new hogwarts robes   has anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said  she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown  hair and rather large front teeth          weve already told him we havent seen it said ron  but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the  wand in his hand   oh are you doing magic lets see it then   she sat down ron looked taken aback   er   all right   he cleared his throat    sunshine  daisies butter mellow   turn this stupid fat rat yellow   he waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers  stayed gray and fast asleep   are you sure thats a real spell said the girl well  its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells  just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in  my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise  when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of  course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft  there is ive heard   ive learned all our course books  by heart of course i just hope it will be enough   im  hermione granger by the way who are you   she said all this very fast   harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his  stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course  books by heart either   im ron weasley ron muttered   harry potter said harry            are you really said hermione i know all about  you of course   i got a few extra books for  background reading and youre in modern magical  history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and  great wizarding events of the twentieth century   am i said harry feeling dazed   goodness didnt you know id have found out  everything i could if it was me said hermione do  either of you know what house youll be in ive been  asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds  by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it  but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad   anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad   you two had better change you know i expect well  be there soon   and she left taking the toadless boy with her   whatever house im in i hope shes not in it said  ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid  spell   george gave it to me bet he knew it was a  dud   what house are your brothers in asked harry   gryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling  on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont  know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose  ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put  me in slytherin   thats the house vol i mean youknowwho was  in     yeah said ron he flopped back into his seat  looking depressed            you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are  a bit lighter said harry trying to take rons mind off  houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that  theyve left anyway   harry was wondering what a wizard did once hed  finished school   charlies in romania studying dragons and bills in  africa doing something for gringotts said ron did  you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily  prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the  muggles   someone tried to rob a high security  vault   harry stared   really what happened to them   nothing thats why its such big news they havent  been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful  dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont  think they took anything thats whats odd course  everyone gets scared when something like this  happens in case youknowwhos behind it   harry turned this news over in his mind he was  starting to get a prickle of fear every time youknow  who was mentioned he supposed this was all part of  entering the magical world but it had been a lot more  comfortable saying voldemort without worrying   whats your quidditch team ron asked   er   i dont know any harry confessed   what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its  the best game in the world    and he was off  explaining all about the four balls and the positions of          the seven players describing famous games hed been  to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to  get if he had the money he was just taking harry  through the finer points of the game when the  compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt  neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this  time   three boys entered and harry recognized the middle  one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins  robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more  interest than hed shown back in diagon alley   is it true he said theyre saying all down the train  that harry potters in this compartment so its you is  it     yes said harry he was looking at the other boys  both of them were thickset and looked extremely  mean standing on either side of the pale boy they  looked like bodyguards   oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale  boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking   and my names malfoy draco malfoy   ron gave a slight cough which might have been  hiding a snigger draco malfoy looked at him   think my names funny do you no need to ask who  you are my father told me all the weasleys have red  hair freckles and more children than they can  afford   he turned back to harry youll soon find out some  wizarding families are much better than others   potter you dont want to go making friends with the  wrong sort i can help you there            he held out his hand to shake harrys but harry  didnt take it   i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself  thanks he said coolly   draco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared  in his pale cheeks   id be careful if i were you potter he said slowly  unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as  your parents they didnt know what was good for  them either you hang around with riffraff like the  weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on you   both harry and ron stood up   say that again ron said his face as red as his hair   oh youre going to fight us are you malfoy  sneered   unless you get out now said harry more bravely  than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot  bigger than him or ron   but we dont feel like leaving do we boys weve  eaten all our food and you still seem to have some   goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to  ron   ron leapt forward but before hed so much as  touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell   scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp  little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle   crabbe  and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers  round and round howling and when scabbers finally  flew off and hit the window all three of them  disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were         more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps  theyd heard footsteps because a second later  hermione granger had come in   what has been going on she said looking at the  sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers  by his tail   i think hes been knocked out ron said to harry   he looked closer at scabbers no   i dont believe it    hes gone back to sleep   and so he had   youve met malfoy before   harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley   ive heard of his family said ron darkly they were  some of the first to come back to our side after you  knowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched  my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father  didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he  turned to hermione can we help you with  something   youd better hurry up and put your robes on ive  just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he  says were nearly there you havent been fighting  have you youll be in trouble before we even get  there   scabbers has been fighting not us said ron  scowling at her would you mind leaving while we  change   all right   i only came in here because people  outside are behaving very childishly racing up and  down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice          and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you  know     ron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the  window it was getting dark he could see mountains  and forests under a deep purple sky the train did  seem to be slowing down   he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their  long black robes rons were a bit short for him you  could see his sneakers underneath them   a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching  hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your  luggage on the train it will be taken to the school  separately   harrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he  saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed  their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined  the crowd thronging the corridor   the train slowed right down and finally stopped  people pushed their way toward the door and out on  to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold  night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads  of the students and harry heard a familiar voice  firs years firs years over here all right there  harry   hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads   cmon follow me   any more firs years mind yer  step now firs years follow me   slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down  what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so  dark on either side of them that harry thought there  must be thick trees there nobody spoke much          neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once  or twice     yehll get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid  called over his shoulder jus round this bend here   there was a loud oooooh   the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge  of a great black lake perched atop a high mountain  on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry  sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers   no moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to  a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore  harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville  and hermione   everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to  himself right then   forward   and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once  gliding across the lake which was as smooth as  glass everyone was silent staring up at the great  castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed  nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood   heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached  the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats  carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide  opening in the cliff face they were carried along a  dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right  underneath the castle until they reached a kind of  underground harbor where they clambered out onto  rocks and pebbles   oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who  was checking the boats as people climbed out of  them          trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his  hands then they clambered up a passageway in the  rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto  smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle   they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded  around the huge oak front door   everyone here you there still got yer toad   hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times  on the castle door                  the sorting hat   the door swung open at once a tall blackhaired  witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a  very stern face and harrys first thought was that this  was not someone to cross   the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid   thank you hagrid i will take them from here   she pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so  big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys  house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming  torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too  high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase  facing them led to the upper floors   they followed professor mcgonagall across the  flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of  hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right   the  rest of the school must already be here   but  professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a  small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in        standing rather closer together than they would  usually have done peering about nervously   welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall  the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but  before you take your seats in the great hall you will  be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very  important ceremony because while you are here  your house will be something like your family within  hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your  house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free  time in your house common room   the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff  ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own  noble history and each has produced outstanding  witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your  triumphs will earn your house points while any rule  breaking will lose house points at the end of the  year the house with the most points is awarded the  house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a  credit to whichever house becomes yours   the sorting ceremony will take place in a few  minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest  you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can  while you are waiting   her eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak  which was fastened under his left ear and on rons  smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his  hair   i shall return when we are ready for you said  professor mcgonagall please wait quietly   she left the chamber harry swallowed            how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked  ron     some sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but  i think he was joking   harrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of  the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet    what on earth would he have to do he hadnt  expected something like this the moment they  arrived he looked around anxiously and saw that  everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking  much except hermione granger who was whispering  very fast about all the spells shed learned and  wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not  to listen to her hed never been more nervous never  not even when hed had to take a school report home  to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his  teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door  any second now professor mcgonagall would come  back and lead him to his doom   then something happened that made him jump about  a foot in the air   several people behind him  screamed   what the      he gasped so did the people around him about  twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back  wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they  glided across the room talking to one another and  hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be  arguing what looked like a fat little monk was  saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give  him a second chance      my dear friar havent we given peeves all the  chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and          you know hes not really even a ghost   i say what  are you all doing here     a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly  noticed the first years   nobody answered   new students said the fat friar smiling around at  them about to be sorted i suppose   a few people nodded mutely   hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old  house you know   move along now said a sharp voice the sorting  ceremonys about to start   professor mcgonagall had returned one by one the  ghosts floated away through the opposite wall   now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first  years and follow me   feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead  harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with  ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber  back across the hall and through a pair of double  doors into the great hall   harry had never even imagined such a strange and  splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands  of candles that were floating in midair over four long  tables where the rest of the students were sitting  these tables were laid with glittering golden plates  and goblets at the top of the hall was another long  table where the teachers were sitting professor  mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they         came to a halt in a line facing the other students  with the teachers behind them the hundreds of faces  staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the  flickering candlelight dotted here and there among  the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to  avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and  saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard  hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky  outside i read about it in hogwarts a history   it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all  and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the  heavens   harry quickly looked down again as professor  mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front  of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed  wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and  extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in  the house   maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry  thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing    noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at  the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there  was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip  near the brim opened wide like a mouth   and the  hat began to sing   oh you may not think im pretty   but dont judge on what you see   ill eat myself if you can find   a smarter hat than me   you can keep your bowlers black            your top hats sleek and tall   for im the hogwarts sorting hat  and i can cap them all   theres nothing hidden in your head  the sorting hat cant see   so try me on and i will tell you  where you ought to be   you might belong in gryffindor   where dwell the brave at heart   their daring nerve and chivalry  set gryffindors apart   you might belong in hufflepuff   where they are just and loyal   those patient hufflepuffs are true  and unafraid of toil   or yet in wise old ravenclaw   if youve a ready mind   where those of wit and learning   will always find their kind   or perhaps in slytherin          youll make your real friends   those cunning folk use any means  to achieve their ends   so put me on dont be afraid l   and dont get in a flap   youre in safe hands though i have none   for im a thinking cap   the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished  its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then  became quite still again   so weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to  harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling  a troll   harry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot  better than having to do a spell but he did wish they  could have tried it on without everyone watching the  hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry didnt feel  brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if  only the hat had mentioned a house for people who  felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for  him   professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a  long roll of parchment   when i call your name you will put on the hat and  sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott  hannah            a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of  line put on the hat which fell right down over her  eyes and sat down a moments pause     hufflepuff shouted the hat   the table on the right cheered and clapped as  hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table   harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at  her   bones susan   hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan  scuttled off to sit next to hannah   boot terry   ravenclaw   the table second from the left clapped this time  several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with  terry as he joined them   brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but  brown lavender became the first new gryffindor  and the table on the far left exploded with cheers  harry could see rons twin brothers catcalling   bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin  perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed  heard about slytherin but he thought they looked  like an unpleasant lot   he was starting to feel definitely sick now he  remembered being picked for teams during gym at his  old school he had always been last to be chosen not  because he was no good but because no one wanted  dudley to think they liked him          finchfletchley justin     hufflepuff   sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the  house at once but at others it took a little while to  decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy  next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a  whole minute before the hat declared him a  gryffindor   granger hermione   hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat  eagerly on her head   gryffindor shouted the hat ron groaned   a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts  always do when youre very nervous what if he  wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with  the hat over his eyes for ages until professor  mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had  obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on  the train   when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his  toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool  the hat took a long time to decide with neville when  it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still  wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter  to give it to macdougal morag   malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called  and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched  his head when it screamed slytherin   malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle  looking pleased with himself          there werent many people left now     moon  nott   parkinson   then a pair of  twin girls path and path   then perks sally  anne     and then at last     potter harry   as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke  out like little hissing fires all over the hall    potter  did she say    the harry potter   the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over  his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a  good look at him next second he was looking at the  black inside of the hat he waited   hmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very  difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind  either theres talent oh my goodness yes   and a  nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting   so where shall i put you   harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not  slytherin not slytherin   not slytherin eh said the small voice are you  sure you could be great you know its all here in  your head and slytherin will help you on the way to  greatness no doubt about that   no well if youre  sure   better be gryffindor   harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole  hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward  the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been  chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed          that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the  prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while  the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got  potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff  hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving  harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it  into a bucket of icecold water   he could see the high table properly now at the end  nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave  him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there  in the center of the high table in a large gold chair  sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once  from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on  the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing  in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts  harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous  young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking  very peculiar in a large purple turban   and now there were only four people left to be sorted  thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron  joined harry at the gryffindor table turpin lisa  became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he  was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers  under the table and a second later the hat had  shouted gryffindor   harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed  into the chair next to him   well done ron excellent said percy weasley  pompously across harry as zabini blaise was  made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her  scroll and took the sorting hat away   harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had  only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin  pasties seemed ages ago          albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was  beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if  nothing could have pleased him more than to see  them all there   welcome he said welcome to a new year at  hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like  to say a few words and here they are nitwit   blubber oddment tweak   thank you   he sat back down everybody clapped and cheered  harry didnt know whether to laugh or not   is he   a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly   mad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard  in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes  harry   harrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him  were now piled with food he had never seen so many  things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast  chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages  bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes  fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy  ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint  humbugs   the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but  hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked  dudley had always taken anything that harry really  wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate  with a bit of everything except the peppermints and  began to eat it was all delicious   that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly  watching harry cut up his steak          cant you        i havent eaten for nearly five hundred years said  the ghost i dont need to of course but one does  miss it i dont think ive introduced myself sir  nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service  resident ghost of gryffindor tower   i know who you are said ron suddenly my  brothers told me about you   youre nearly headless  nick   i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy     the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus  finnigan interrupted   nearly headless how can you be nearly headless   sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little  chat wasnt going at all the way he wanted   like this he said irritably he seized his left ear and  pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell  onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone  had obviously tried to behead him but not done it  properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on  their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head  back onto his neck coughed and said so   new  gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the  house championship this year gryffindors have  never gone so long without winning slytherins have  got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons  becoming almost unbearable   hes the slytherin  ghost   harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a  horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a  gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he  was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to          see didnt look too pleased with the seating  arrangements   how did he get covered in blood asked seamus  with great interest   ive never asked said nearly headless nick  delicately   when everyone had eaten as much as they could the  remains of the food faded from the plates leaving  them sparkling clean as before a moment later the  desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor  you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate  eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell   rice pudding    as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk  turned to their families   im halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle  mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they  were married bit of a nasty shock for him   the others laughed   what about you neville said ron   well my gran brought me up and shes a witch  said neville but the family thought i was all muggle  for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me  off my guard and force some magic out of me   he  pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly  drowned   but nothing happened until i was eight  great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was  hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles  when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue  and he accidentally let go but i bounced   all the  way down the garden and into the road they were all         really pleased gran was crying she was so happy  and you should have seen their faces when i got in  here   they thought i might not be magic enough to  come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he  bought me my toad   on harrys other side percy weasley and hermione  were talking about lessons i do hope they start right  away theres so much to learn im particularly  interested in transfiguration you know turning  something into something else of course its  supposed to be very difficult   youll be starting  small just matches into needles and that sort of  thing        harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy  looked up at the high table again hagrid was  drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall  was talking to professor dumbledore professor  quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a  teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and  sallow skin   it happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher  looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys  eyes   and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on  harrys forehead   ouch harry clapped a hand to his head   what is it asked percy   nnothing   the pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder  to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the  teachers look   a feeling that he didnt like harry at  all            whos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he  asked percy   oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder  hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he  teaches potions but he doesnt want to   everyone  knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot  about the dark arts snape   harry watched snape for a while but snape didnt  look at him again   at last the desserts too disappeared and professor  dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silent   ahem   just a few more words now that we are all  fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to  give you   first years should note that the forest on the  grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our  older students would do well to remember that as  well   dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction  of the weasley twins   i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to  remind you all that no magic should be used between  classes in the corridors   quidditch trials will be held in the second week of  the term anyone interested in playing for their house  teams should contact madam hooch   and finally i must tell you that this year the third  floor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds  to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful  death          harry laughed but he was one of the few who did     hes not serious he muttered to percy   must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its  odd because he usually gives us a reason why were  not allowed to go somewhere   the forests full of  dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he  might have told us prefects at least   and now before we go to bed let us sing the school  song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other  teachers smiles had become rather fixed   dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was  trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden  ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables  and twisted itself snakelike into words   everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore  and off we go   and the school bellowed   hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts   teach us something please   whether we be old and bald  or young with scabby knees   our heads could do with filling  with some interesting stuff   for now theyre bare and full of air   dead flies and bits of fluff          so teach us things worth knowing   bring back what weve forgot   just do your best well do the rest   and learn until our brains all rot   everybody finished the song at different times at last  only the weasley twins were left singing along to a  very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their  last few lines with his wand and when they had  finished he was one of those who clapped loudest   ah music he said wiping his eyes a magic  beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you  trot   the gryffindor first years followed percy through the  chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the  marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again  but only because he was so tired and full of food he  was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in  the portraits along the corridors whispered and  pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them  through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and  hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases  yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just  wondering how much farther they had to go when  they came to a sudden halt   a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair  ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them  they started throwing themselves at him   peeves percy whispered to the first years a  poltergeist he raised his voice peeves   show  yourself            a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a  balloon answered   do you want me to go to the bloody baron   there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark  eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross  legged in the air clutching the walking sticks   oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle  firsties what fun   he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked   go away peeves or the baronll hear about this i  mean it barked percy   peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping  the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him  zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed   you want to watch out for peeves said percy as  they set off again the bloody barons the only one  who can control him he wont even listen to us  prefects here we are   at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a  very fat woman in a pink silk dress   password she said   caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung  forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all  scrambled through it   neville needed a leg up    and found themselves in the gryffindor common  room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs   percy directed the girls through one door to their  dormitory and the boys through another at the top of          a spiral staircase   they were obviously in one of the  towers   they found their beds at last five four  posters hung with deep red velvet curtains their  trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk  much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed   great food isnt it ron muttered to harry through  the hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my  sheets   harry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the  treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once   perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he  had a very strange dream he was wearing professor  quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling  him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it  was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want  to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried  to pull it off but it tightened painfully   and there  was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it    then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher  snape whose laugh became high and cold   there  was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating  and shaking   he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he  woke next day he didnt remember the dream at all              the potions master   there look   where   next to the tall kid with the red hair   wearing the glasses   did you see his face   did you see his scar   whispers followed harry from the moment he left his  dormitory the next day people lining up outside  classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or  doubled back to pass him in the corridors again  staring harry wished they wouldnt because he was  trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes   there were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at  hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones  some that led somewhere different on a friday some         with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to  remember to jump then there were doors that  wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled  them in exactly the right place and doors that werent  really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it  was also very hard to remember where anything was  because it all seemed to move around a lot the  people in the portraits kept going to visit each other  and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk   the ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty  shock when one of them glided suddenly through a  door you were trying to open nearly headless nick  was always happy to point new gryffindors in the  right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth  two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him  when you were late for class he would drop  wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from  under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak  up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech  got your conk   even worse than peeves if that was possible was the  caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get  on the wrong side of him on their very first morning  filch found them trying to force their way through a  door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to  the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he  wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were  trying to break into it on purpose and was  threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they  were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing   filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dust  colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like  filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule  in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed  whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two  seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of         the school better than anyone except perhaps the  weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any  of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was  the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a  good kick   and then once you had managed to find them there  were the classes themselves there was a lot more to  magic as harry quickly found out than waving your  wand and saying a few funny words   they had to study the night skies through their  telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn  the names of different stars and the movements of the  planets three times a week they went out to the  greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology  with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout  where they learned how to take care of all the strange  plants and fungi and found out what they were used  for   easily the most boring class was history of magic  which was the only one taught by a ghost professor  binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen  asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next  morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns  droned on and on while they scribbled down names  and dates and got emeric the evil and uric the  oddball mixed up   professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny  little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to  see over his desk at the start of their first class he  took the roll call and when he reached harrys name  he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight   professor mcgonagall was again different harry had  been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to            cross strict and clever she gave them a talking to  the moment they sat down in her first class   transfiguration is some of the most complex and  dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she  said anyone messing around in my class will leave  and not come back you have been warned   then she changed her desk into a pig and back again  they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get  started but soon realized they werent going to be  changing the furniture into animals for a long time  after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each  given a match and started trying to turn it into a  needle by the end of the lesson only hermione  granger had made any difference to her match  professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had  gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare  smile   the class everyone had really been looking forward to  was defense against the dark arts but quirrells  lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom  smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to  ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was  afraid would be coming back to get him one of these  days his turban he told them had been given to him  by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of  a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they  believed this story for one thing when seamus  finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had  fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started  talking about the weather for another they had  noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban  and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full  of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected  wherever he went            harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt  miles behind everyone else lots of people had come  from muggle families and like him hadnt had any  idea that they were witches and wizards there was so  much to learn that even people like ron didnt have  much of a head start   friday was an important day for harry and ron they  finally managed to find their way down to the great  hall for breakfast without getting lost once   what have we got today harry asked ron as he  poured sugar on his porridge   double potions with the slytherins said ron  snapes head of slytherin house they say he always  favors them   well be able to see if its true   wish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor  mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it  hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of  homework the day before   just then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to  this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on  the first morning when about a hundred owls had  suddenly streamed into the great hall during  breakfast circling the tables until they saw their  owners and dropping letters and packages onto their  laps   hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she  sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of  toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the  other school owls this morning however she  fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar  bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry  tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl            dear harry     i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like  to come and have a cup of tea with me around three   i want to hear all about your first week send us an  answer back with hedwig   hagrid   harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see  you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off  again   it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look  forward to because the potions lesson turned out to  be the worst thing that had happened to him so far   at the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the  idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of  the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong  snape didnt dislike harry   he hated him   potions lessons took place down in one of the  dungeons it was colder here than up in the main  castle and would have been quite creepy enough  without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all  around the walls   snape like flitwick started the class by taking the  roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys name   ah yes he said softly harry potter our new    celebrity   draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle  sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling  the names and looked up at the class his eyes were  black like hagrid s but they had none of hagrid s          warmth they were cold and empty and made you  think of dark tunnels   you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art  of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more  than a whisper but they caught every word   like  professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a  class silent without effort as there is little foolish  wand waving here many of you will hardly believe  this is magic i dont expect you will really understand  the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its  shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that  creep through human veins bewitching the mind  ensnaring the senses  i can teach you how to bottle  fame brew glory even stopper death   if you arent  as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to  teach   more silence followed this little speech harry and  ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione  granger was on the edge of her seat and looked  desperate to start proving that she wasnt a  dunderhead   potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i  added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of  wormwood   powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry  glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was  hermione s hand had shot into the air   i dont know sir said harry   snape s lips curled into a sneer   tut tut   fame clearly isnt everything   he ignored hermione s hand          lets try again potter where would you look if i told  you to find me a bezoar   hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it  would go without her leaving her seat but harry  didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he  tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who  were shaking with laughter   i dont know sir   thought you wouldnt open a book before coming  eh potter   harry forced himself to keep looking straight into  those cold eyes he had looked through his books at  the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember  everything in one thousand magical herbs and  fungi    snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering hand   what is the difference potter between monkshood  and wolfsbane   at this hermione stood up her hand stretching  toward the dungeon ceiling   i dont know said harry quietly i think hermione  does though why dont you try her   a few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye  and seamus winked snape however was not  pleased   sit down he snapped at hermione for your  information potter asphodel and wormwood make a  sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the  draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken          from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from  most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they  are the same plant which also goes by the name of  aconite well why arent you all copying that down   there was a sudden rummaging for quills and  parchment over the noise snape said and a point  will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek  potter   things didnt improve for the gryffindors as the  potions lesson continued snape put them all into  pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to  cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak  watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake  fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy  whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone  to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his  horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a  loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow  managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted  blob and their potion was seeping across the stone  floor burning holes in peoples shoes within  seconds the whole class was standing on their stools  while neville who had been drenched in the potion  when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as  angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs   idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion  away with one wave of his wand i suppose you  added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron  off the fire   neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over  his nose   take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at  seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who  had been working next to neville          you   potter   why didnt you tell him not to add  the quills thought hed make you look good if he got  it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for  gryffindor   this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to  argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron   dont push it he muttered ive heard snape can  turn very nasty   as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour  later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were  low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very  first week   why did snape hate him so much   cheer up said ron snapes always taking points  off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid  with you   at five to three they left the castle and made their way  across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden  house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow  and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door   when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling  from inside and several booming barks then hagrid s  voice rang out saying back fang   back   hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he  pulled the door open   hang on he said back fang   he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar  of an enormous black boarhound   there was only one room inside hams and pheasants  were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was          boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a  massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it   make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of  fang who bounded straight at ron and started  licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as  fierce as he looked   this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring  boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock  cakes onto a plate   another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons  freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers  away from the forest   the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins  that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron  pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all  about their first lessons fang rested his head on  harrys knee and drooled all over his robes   harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call  filch that old git   an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce  her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up  ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get  rid of her   filch puts her up to it   harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like  ron told harry not to worry about it that snape  liked hardly any of the students   but he seemed to really hate me   rubbish said hagrid why should he            yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt  quite meet his eyes when he said that   hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i  liked him a lot   great with animals   harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on  purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies  work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper  that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was  a cutting from the daily prophet    gringotts breakin latest   investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts  on   july widely believed to be the work of dark  wizards or witches unknown   gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had  been taken the vault that was searched had in fact  been emptied the same day   but were not telling you what was in there so keep  your noses out if you know whats good for you said  a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon   harry remembered ron telling him on the train that  someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt  mentioned the date   hagrid said harry that gringotts breakin  happened on my birthday it mightve been happening  while we were there   there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt  meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered  him another rock cake harry read the story again   the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied  earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven         hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying  taking out that grubby little package had that been  what the thieves were looking for   as harry and ron walked back to the castle for  dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes  theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that  none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as  much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid  collected that package just in time where was it  now and did hagrid know something about snape  that he didnt want to tell harry                  the midnight duel   harry had never believed he would meet a boy he  hated more than dudley but that was before he met  draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had  potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put  up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until  they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor  common room that made them all groan flying  lessons would be starting on thursday   and  gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together   typical said harry darkly just what i always  wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in  front of malfoy   he had been looking forward to learning to fly more  than anything else   you dont know that youll make a fool of yourself  said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always  going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet  thats all talk         malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot he  complained loudly about first years never getting on  the house quidditch teams and told long boastful  stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly  escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only  one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed  spent most of his childhood zooming around the  countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell  anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a  hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from  wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly  ron had already had a big argument with dean  thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer  ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with  only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry  had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham  soccer team trying to make the players move   neville had never been on a broomstick in his life  because his grandmother had never let him near one  privately harry felt shed had good reason because  neville managed to have an extraordinary number of  accidents even with both feet on the ground   hermione granger was almost as nervous about  flying as neville was this was something you couldnt  learn by heart out of a book   not that she hadnt  tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all  stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library  book called quidditch through the ages neville was  hanging on to her every word desperate for anything  that might help him hang on to his broomstick later  but everybody else was very pleased when hermione s  lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail   harry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note  something that malfoy had been quick to notice of  course malfoy s eagle owl was always bringing him            packages of sweets from home which he opened  gloatingly at the slytherin table   a barn owl brought neville a small package from his  grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed  them a glass ball the size of a large marble which  seemed to be full of white smoke   its a remembrall he explained gran knows i  forget things   this tells you if theres something  youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this  and if it turns red   oh  his face fell because the  remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet  youve  forgotten something    neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten  when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor  table snatched the remembrall out of his hand   harry and ron jumped to their feet they were half  hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor  mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any  teacher in the school was there in a flash   whats going on   malfoys got my remembrall professor   scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall  back on the table   just looking he said and he sloped away with  crabbe and goyle behind him   at threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the  other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto  the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear  breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as  they marched down the sloping lawns toward a         smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds  to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying  darkly in the distance   the slytherins were already there and so were twenty  broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry  had heard fred and george weasley complain about  the school brooms saying that some of them started  to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly  to the left   their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short  gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk   well what are you all waiting for she barked  everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry  up    harry glanced down at his broom it was old and  some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles   stick out your right hand over your broom called  madam hooch at the front and say up    up everyone shouted   harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it  was one of the few that did hermione grangers had  simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt  moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell  when you were afraid thought harry there was a  quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that  he wanted to keep his feet on the ground   madam hooch then showed them how to mount their  brooms without sliding off the end and walked up  and down the rows correcting their grips harry and  ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been  doing it wrong for years          now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the  ground hard said madam hooch keep your  brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight  back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle    three   two      but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of  being left on the ground pushed off hard before the  whistle had touched madam hoochs lips   come back boy she shouted but neville was rising  straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle   twelve  feet   twenty feet harry saw his scared white face  look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp  slip sideways off the broom and     wham   a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay  facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was  still rising higher and higher and started to drift  lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight   madam hooch was bending over neville her face as  white as his   broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on  boy   its all right up you get   she turned to the rest of the class   none of you is to move while i take this boy to the  hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are  or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say  quidditch come on dear   neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist  hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm  around him            no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst  into laughter   did you see his face the great lump   the other slytherins joined in   shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil   ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy  parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought  youd like fat little crybabies parvati   look said malfoy darting forward and snatching  something out of the grass its that stupid thing  longbottoms gran sent him   the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up   give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone  stopped talking to watch   malfoy smiled nastily   i think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find    how about   up a tree   give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto  his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he  could fly well hovering level with the topmost  branches of an oak he called come and get it  potter   harry grabbed his broom   ivo shouted hermione granger madam hooch told  us not to move   youll get us all into trouble            harry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears   he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the  ground and up up he soared air rushed through his  hair and his robes whipped out behind him   and in  a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something  he could do without being taught   this was easy  this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a  little to take it even higher and heard screams and  gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring  whoop from ron   he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in  midair malfoy looked stunned   give it here harry called or ill knock you off that  broom   oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking  worried   harry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward  and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it  shot toward malfoy like a javelin malfoy only just got  out of the way in time harry made a sharp about  face and held the broom steady a few people below  were clapping   no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck  malfoy harry called   the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy   catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw  the glass ball high into the air and streaked back  toward the ground   harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up  in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward  and pointed his broom handle down   next second          he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball    wind whistled in his ears mingled with the  screams of people watching   he stretched out his  hand   a foot from the ground he caught it just in  time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently  onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in  his fist   harry potter   his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor  mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his  feet trembling   never   in all my time at hogwarts      professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with  shock and her glasses flashed furiously    how dare  you   might have broken your neck      it wasnt his fault professor      be quiet miss patil      but malfoy      thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now   harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles  triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in  professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the  castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it   he wanted to say something to defend himself but  there seemed to be something wrong with his voice  professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without  even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now  hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be  packing his bags in ten minutes what would the  dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep         up the front steps up the marble staircase inside  and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to  him she wrenched open doors and marched along  corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her  maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he  thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as  gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant  his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron  and the others becoming wizards while he stumped  around the grounds carrying hagrids bag   professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom  she opened the door and poked her head inside   excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood  for a moment   wood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane  she was going to use on him   but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear  boy who came out of flitwicks class looking  confused   follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and  they marched on up the corridor wood looking  curiously at harry   in here   professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom  that was empty except for peeves who was busy  writing rude words on the blackboard   out peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk  into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out  cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door  behind him and turned to face the two boys            potter this is oliver wood wood   ive found you a  seeker   woods expression changed from puzzlement to  delight   are you serious professor   absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the  boys a natural ive never seen anything like it was  that your first time on a broomstick potter   harry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was  going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and  some of the feeling started coming back to his legs   he caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot  dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even  scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done  it   wood was now looking as though all his dreams had  come true at once   ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked  excitedly   woods captain of the gryffindor team professor  mcgonagall explained   hes just the build for a seeker too said wood now  walking around harry and staring at him light    speedy   well have to get him a decent broom  professor   a nimbus two thousand or a  cleansweep seven id say   i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we  cant bend the firstyear rule heaven knows we need  a better team than last year flattened in that last          match by slytherin i couldnt look severus snape in  the face for weeks    professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses  at harry   i want to hear youre training hard potter or i may  change my mind about punishing you   then she suddenly smiled   your father would have been proud she said he  was an excellent quidditch player himself   youre joking   it was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron  what had happened when hed left the grounds with  professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and  kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all  about it   seeker he said but first years never   you must  be the youngest house player in about         a century said harry shoveling pie into his  mouth he felt particularly hungry after the  excitement of the afternoon wood told me   ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and  gaped at harry   i start training next week said harry only dont  tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret   fred and george weasley now came into the hall  spotted harry and hurried over            well done said george in a low voice wood told us  were on the team too   beaters   i tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for  sure this year said fred we havent won since  charlie left but this years team is going to be  brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost  skipping when he told us   anyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes  found a new secret passageway out of the school   bet its that one behind the statue of gregory the  smarmy that we found in our first week see you   fred and george had hardly disappeared when  someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked  by crabbe and goyle   having a last meal potter when are you getting the  train back to the muggles   youre a lot braver now that youre back on the  ground and youve got your little friends with you  said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all  little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table  was full of teachers neither of them could do more  than crack their knuckles and scowl   id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy  tonight if you want wizards duel wands only    no contact whats the matter never heard of a  wizards duel before i suppose   of course he has said ron wheeling around im  his second whos yours   malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up            crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you  in the trophy room thats always unlocked   when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each  other   what is a wizards duel said harry and what do  you mean youre my second   well a seconds there to take over if you die said  ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie  catching the look on harrys face he added quickly  but people only die in proper duels you know with  real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do  is send sparks at each other neither of you knows  enough magic to do any real damage i bet he  expected you to refuse anyway   and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens   throw it away and punch him on the nose ron  suggested   excuse me   they both looked up it was hermione granger   cant a person eat in peace in this place said ron   hermione ignored him and spoke to harry   i couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy  were saying      bet you could ron muttered      and you mustnt go wandering around the school  at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if            youre caught and youre bound to be its really very  selfish of you   and its really none of your business said harry  goodbye said ron   all the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end  to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later  listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville  wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent  all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to  curse you youd better dodge it because i cant  remember how to block them there was a very good  chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs  norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck  breaking another school rule today on the other  hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of  the darkness   this was his big chance to beat  malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss it   halfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better  go   they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their  wands and crept across the tower room down the  spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common  room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace  turning all the armchairs into hunched black  shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole  when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i  cant believe youre going to do this harry   a lamp flickered on it was hermione granger  wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown   you said ron furiously go back to bed            i almost told your brother hermione snapped   percy   hes a prefect hed put a stop to this   harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering   come on he said to ron he pushed open the  portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole   hermione wasnt going to give up that easily she  followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at  them like an angry goose   dont you care about gryffindor do you only care  about yourselves  dont want slytherin to win the  house cup and youll lose all the points i got from  professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching  spells   go away   all right but i warned you you just remember what  i said when youre on the train home tomorrow  youre so      but what they were they didnt find out hermione  had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back  inside and found herself facing an empty painting   the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and  hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower   now what am i going to do she asked shrilly   thats your problem said ron weve got to go  were going to be late   they hadnt even reached the end of the corridor  when hermione caught up with them   im coming with you she said          you are not     dyou think im going to stand out here and wait for  filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell  him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you  can back me up   youve got some nerve    said ron loudly   shut up both of you said harry sharply i heard  something   it was a sort of snuffling   mrs norris breathed ron squinting through the  dark   it wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up  on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake  as they crept nearer   thank goodness you found me ive been out here for  hours i couldnt remember the new password to get  in to bed   keep your voice down neville the passwords pig  snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone  off somewhere   hows your arm said harry   fine said neville showing them madam pomfrey  mended it in about a minute   good   well look neville weve got to be  somewhere well see you later               dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet   i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons  been past twice already   ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at  hermione and neville   if either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive  learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us  about and used it on you   hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron  exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry  hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all  forward   they flitted along corridors striped with bars of  moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry  expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they  were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor  and tiptoed toward the trophy room   malfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal  trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught  them cups shields plates and statues winked silver  and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls  keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the  room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in  and started at once the minutes crept by   hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered   then a noise in the next room made them jump   harry had only just raised his wand when they heard  someone speak   and it wasnt malfoy   sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a  corner            it was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck  harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as  quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the  door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had  barely whipped round the corner when they heard  filch enter the trophy room   theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter  probably hiding   this way harry mouthed to the others and  petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full  of suits of armor they could hear filch getting  nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak  and broke into a run   he tripped grabbed ron  around the waist and the pair of them toppled right  into a suit of armor   the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the  whole castle   run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted  down the gallery not looking back to see whether  filch was following   they swung around the  doorpost and galloped down one corridor then  another harry in the lead without any idea where  they were or where they were going   they ripped  through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden  passageway hurtled along it and came out near their  charms classroom which they knew was miles from  the trophy room   i think weve lost him harry panted leaning against  the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was  bent double wheezing and spluttering   i   told   you hermione gasped clutching at the  stitch in her chest i   told   you            weve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron  quickly as possible   malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you  realize that dont you he was never going to meet  you   filch knew someone was going to be in the  trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off   harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt  going to tell her that   lets go   it wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone  more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled  and something came shooting out of a classroom in  front of them   it was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a  squeal of delight   shut up peeves   please   youll get us thrown  out   peeves cackled   wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut  tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughty   not if you dont give us away peeves please   should tell filch i should said peeves in a sanity  voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your  own good you know   get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at  peeves   this was a big mistake            students out of bed peeves bellowed  students out of bed down the charms  corridor   ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right  to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a  door   and it was locked   this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at  the door were done for this is the end   they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he  could toward peeves s shouts   oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed  harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered  alohomora   the lock clicked and the door swung open   they  piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their  ears against it listening   which way did they go peeves filch was saying  quick tell me   say please    dont mess with me peeves now where did they go   shant say nothing if you dont say please said  peeves in his annoying singsong voice   all right   please   nothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing  if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they  heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch  cursing in rage            he thinks this door is locked harry whispered i  think well be okay   get off neville for neville had  been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the  last minute what   harry turned around   and saw quite clearly what  for a moment he was sure hed walked into a  nightmare   this was too much on top of everything  that had happened so far   they werent in a room as he had supposed they  were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third  floor and now they knew why it was forbidden   they were looking straight into the eyes of a  monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space  between ceiling and floor it had three heads three  pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and  quivering in their direction three drooling mouths  saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs   it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them  and harry knew that the only reason they werent  already dead was that their sudden appearance had  taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over  that there was no mistaking what those thunderous  growls meant   harry groped for the doorknob   between filch and  death hed take filch   they fell backward   harry slammed the door shut  and they ran they almost flew back down the  corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them  somewhere else because they didnt see him  anywhere but they hardly cared   all they wanted to  do was put as much space as possible between them  and that monster they didnt stop running until they            reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh  floor   where on earth have you all been she asked  looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders  and their flushed sweaty faces   never mind that   pig snout pig snout panted  harry and the portrait swung forward they  scrambled into the common room and collapsed  trembling into armchairs   it was a while before any of them said anything  neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again   what do they think theyre doing keeping a thing  like that locked up in a school said ron finally if  any dog needs exercise that one does   hermione had got both her breath and her bad  temper back again   you dont use your eyes any of you do you she  snapped didnt you see what it was standing on   the floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its  feet i was too busy with its heads   no not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its  obviously guarding something   she stood up glaring at them   i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all  have been killed   or worse expelled now if you  dont mind im going to bed   ron stared after her his mouth open            no we dont mind he said youd think we dragged  her along wouldnt you   but hermione had given harry something else to  think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was  guarding something    what had hagrid said  gringotts was the safest place in the world for  something you wanted to hide   except perhaps  hogwarts   it looked as though harry had found out where the  grubby little package from vault seven hundred and  thirteen was                  halloween   malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that  harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day  looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by the  next morning harry and ron thought that meeting  the threeheaded dog had been an excellent  adventure and they were quite keen to have another  one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the  package that seemed to have been moved from  gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time  wondering what could possibly need such heavy  protection   its either really valuable or really dangerous said  ron   or both said harry   but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious  object was that it was about two inches long they  didnt have much chance of guessing what it was  without further clues         neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest  interest in what lay underneath the dog and the  trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near  the dog again   hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and  ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they  saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted  now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their  great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail  about a week later   as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual  everyones attention was caught at once by a long  thin package carried by six large screech owls harry  was just as interested as everyone else to see what  was in this large parcel and was amazed when the  owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him  knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly  fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a  letter on top of the parcel   harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky  because it said     do not open the parcel at the table   it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i  dont want everybody knowing youve got a  broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will  meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven  oclock for your first training session   professor m mcgonagall   harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the  note to ron to read          a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously  ive never even touched one   they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the  broomstick in private before their first class but  halfway across the entrance hall they found the way  upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized  the package from harry and felt it   thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to  harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face  youll be in for it this time potter first years arent  allowed them   ron couldnt resist it   its not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus  two thousand what did you say youve got at home  malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry  comets look flashy but theyre not in the same  league as the nimbus   what would you know about it weasley you  couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back  i suppose you and your brothers have to save up  twig by twig   before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared  at malfoys elbow   not arguing i hope boys he squeaked   potters been sent a broomstick professor said  malfoy quickly   yes yes thats right said professor flitwick  beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all  about the special circumstances potter and what  model is it          a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting  not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face  and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it  he added   harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their  laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion   well its true harry chortled as they reached the  top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen  nevilles remembrall i wouldnt be on the team    so i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking  rules came an angry voice from just behind them  hermione was stomping up the stairs looking  disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand   i thought you werent speaking to us said harry   yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so  much good   hermione marched away with her nose in the air   harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his  lessons that day it kept wandering up to the  dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under  his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where  hed be learning to play that night he bolted his  dinner that evening without noticing what he was  eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap  the nimbus two thousand at last   wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto  harrys bedspread   even harry who knew nothing about the different  brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and  shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of          neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand  written in gold near the top   as seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and  set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field hed  never been inside the stadium before hundreds of  seats were raised in stands around the field so that  the spectators were high enough to see what was  going on at either end of the field were three golden  poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of  the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles  through except that they were fifty feet high   too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry  mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the  ground what a feeling   he swooped in and out of  the goal posts and then sped up and down the field  the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he  wanted at his lightest touch   hey potter come down   oliver wood had arrived he was carrying a large  wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to  him   very nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what  mcgonagall meant  you really are a natural im  just going to teach you the rules this evening then  youll be joining team practice three times a week   he opened the crate inside were four differentsized  balls   right said wood now quidditch is easy enough to  understand even if its not too easy to play there are  seven players on each side three of them are called  chasers            three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a  bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball   this balls called the quaffle said wood the  chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and  get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten  points every time the quaffle goes through one of the  hoops follow me   the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through  the hoops to score harry recited so   thats sort of  like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt  it     whats basketball said wood curiously   never mind said harry quickly   now theres another player on each side whos called  the keeper   im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly  around our hoops and stop the other team from  scoring   three chasers one keeper said harry who was  determined to remember it all and they play with  the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he  pointed at the three balls left inside the box   ill show you now said wood take this   he handed harry a small club a bit like a short  baseball bat   im going to show you what the bludgers do wood  said these two are the bludgers   he showed harry two identical balls jet black and  slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed            that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps  holding them inside the box   stand back wood warned harry he bent down and  freed one of the bludgers   at once the black ball rose high in the air and then  pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with  the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it  zigzagging away into the air   it zoomed around their  heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it  and managed to pin it to the ground   see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger  back into the crate and strapping it down safely the  bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off  their brooms thats why you have two beaters on  each team   the weasley twins are ours   its their  job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and  knock them toward the other team so   think youve  got all that   three chasers try and score with the quaffle the  keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the  bludgers away from their team harry reeled off   very good said wood   er   have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry  asked hoping he sounded offhand   never at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken  jaws but nothing worse than that now the last  member of the team is the seeker thats you and  you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the  bludgers         unless they crack my head open            dont worry the weasleys are more than a match for  the bludgers   i mean theyre like a pair of human  bludgers themselves   wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth  and last ball compared with the quaffle and the  bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut  it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver  wings   this said wood is the golden snitch and its the  most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch  because its so fast and difficult to see its the  seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out  of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get  it before the other teams seeker because whichever  seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra  hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win  thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of  quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it  can go on for ages   i think the record is three  months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so  the players could get some sleep   well thats it   any questions   harry shook his head he understood what he had to  do all right it was doing it that was going to be the  problem   we wont practice with the snitch yet said wood  carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too  dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of  these   he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket  and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the  air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could  in every direction for harry to catch          harry didnt miss a single one and wood was  delighted after half an hour night had really fallen  and they couldnt carry on   that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year  said wood happily as they trudged back up to the  castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better  than charlie weasley and he could have played for  england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons   perhaps it was because he was now so busy what  with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top  of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it  when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts  two months the castle felt more like home than  privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming  more and more interesting now that they had  mastered the basics   on halloween morning they woke to the delicious  smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the  corridors even better professor flitwick announced  in charms that he thought they were ready to start  making objects fly something they had all been dying  to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom  around the classroom professor flitwick put the  class into pairs to practice harrys partner was  seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville  had been trying to catch his eye ron however was  to be working with hermione granger it was hard to  tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this  she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day  harrys broomstick had arrived   now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve  been practicing squeaked professor flitwick  perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish  and flick remember swish and flick and saying the  magic words properly is very important too   never         forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and  found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his  chest   it was very difficult harry and seamus swished and  flicked but the feather they were supposed to be  sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got  so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set  fire to it   harry had to put it out with his hat   ron at the next table wasnt having much more  luck   wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long  arms like a windmill   youre saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap  its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and  long   you do it then if youre so clever ron snarled   hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked  her wand and said wingardium leviosav   their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four  feet above their heads   oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping  everyone see here miss grangers done it   ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class   its no wonder no one can stand her he said to  harry as they pushed their way into the crowded  corridor shes a nightmare honestly            someone knocked into harry as they hurried past  him it was hermione harry caught a glimpse of her  face   and was startled to see that she was in tears   i think she heard you   so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable  she mustve noticed shes got no friends   hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt  seen all afternoon on their way down to the great  hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard  parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione  was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be  left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but  a moment later they had entered the great hall  where the halloween decorations put hermione out of  their minds   a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and  ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the  tables in low black clouds making the candles in the  pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on  the golden plates as it had at the startofterm  banquet   harry was just helping himself to a baked potato  when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall  his turban askew and terror on his face everyone  stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair  slumped against the table and gasped troll   in  the dungeons   thought you ought to know   he then sank to the floor in a dead faint   there was an uproar it took several purple  firecrackers exploding from the end of professor  dumbledores wand to bring silence            prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the  dormitories immediately   percy was in his element   follow me stick together first years no need to fear  the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind  me now make way first years coming through  excuse me im a prefect   how could a troll get in harry asked as they  climbed the stairs   dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid  said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween  joke   they passed different groups of people hurrying in  different directions as they jostled their way through  a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly  grabbed rons arm   ive just thought   hermione   what about her   she doesnt know about the troll   ron bit his lip   oh all right he snapped but percyd better not  see us   ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the  other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and  hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just  turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps  behind them            percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large  stone griffin   peering around it however they saw not percy but  snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from  view   whats he doing harry whispered why isnt he  down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers   search me   quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor  after snape s fading footsteps   hes heading for the third floor harry said but ron  held up his hand   can you smell something   harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a  mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no  one seems to clean   and then they heard it   a low grunting and the  shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed   at  the end of a passage to the left something huge was  moving toward them they shrank into the shadows  and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight   it was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a  dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder  with its small bald head perched on top like a  coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with  flat horny feet the smell coming from it was  incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which  dragged along the floor because its arms were so long            the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside  it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then  slouched slowly into the room   the keys in the lock harry muttered we could  lock it in   good idea said ron nervously   they edged toward the open door mouths dry  praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with  one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam  the door and lock it   yes   flushed with their victory they started to run back  up the passage but as they reached the corner they  heard something that made their hearts stop   a  high petrified scream   and it was coming from the  chamber theyd just chained up   oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron   its the girls bathroom harry gasped    hermionel they said together   it was the last thing they wanted to do but what  choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted  back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their  panic harry pulled the door open and they ran  inside   hermione granger was shrinking against the wall  opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll  was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the  walls as it went            confuse it harry said desperately to ron and  seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against  the wall   the troll stopped a few feet from hermione it  lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had  made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it  hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club  as it went   oy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the  chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll  didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its  shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again  turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving  harry time to run around it   come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying  to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move  she was still flat against the wall her mouth open  with terror   the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the  troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron  who was nearest and had no way to escape   harry then did something that was both very brave  and very stupid he took a great running jump and  managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck  from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging  there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit  of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been  in his hand when hed jumped   it had gone straight  up one of the trolls nostrils   howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its  club with harry clinging on for dear life any second  the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a  terrible blow with the club          hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled  out his own wand   not knowing what he was going  to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came  into his head wingardium leviosal   the club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose  high high up into the air turned slowly over   and  dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners  head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat  on its face with a thud that made the whole room  tremble   harry got to his feet he was shaking and out of  breath ron was standing there with his wand still  raised staring at what he had done   it was hermione who spoke first   is it   dead   i dont think so said harry i think its just been  knocked out   he bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls  nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray  glue   urgh   troll boogers   he wiped it on the trolls trousers   a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the  three of them look up they hadnt realized what a  racket they had been making but of course someone  downstairs must have heard the crashes and the  trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall  had come bursting into the room closely followed by  snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell            took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and  sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart   snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was  looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her  look so angry her lips were white hopes of winning  fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys  mind   what on earth were you thinking of said professor  mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked  at ron who was still standing with his wand in the  air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you  in your dormitory   snape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked  at the floor he wished ron would put his wand down   then a small voice came out of the shadows   please professor mcgonagall   they were looking for  me   miss granger   hermione had managed to get to her feet at last   i went looking for the troll because i   i thought i  could deal with it on my own   you know because  ive read all about them   ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a  downright lie to a teacher   if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry  stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out  with its own club they didnt have time to come and  fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they  arrived          harry and ron tried to look as though this story  wasnt new to them   well   in that case  said professor mcgonagall  staring at the three of them miss granger you  foolish girl how could you think of tackling a  mountain troll on your own   hermione hung her head harry was speechless  hermione was the last person to do anything against  the rules and here she was pretending she had to  get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started  handing out sweets   miss granger five points will be taken from  gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im  very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all  youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are  finishing the feast in their houses   hermione left   professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron   well i still say you were lucky but not many first  years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain  troll you each win gryffindor five points professor  dumbledore will be informed of this you may go   they hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at  all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief  to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from  anything else   we should have gotten more than ten points ron  grumbled   five you mean once shes taken off hermione s            good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron  admitted mind you we did save her   she might not have needed saving if we hadnt  locked the thing in with her harry reminded him   they had reached the portrait of the fat lady   pig snout they said and entered   the common room was packed and noisy everyone  was eating the food that had been sent up hermione  however stood alone by the door waiting for them  there was a very embarrassed pause then none of  them looking at each other they all said thanks  and hurried off to get plates   but from that moment on hermione granger became  their friend there are some things you cant share  without ending up liking each other and knocking  out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them             quidditch   as they entered november the weather turned very  cold the mountains around the school became icy  gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the  ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen  from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on  the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin  overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin  boots   the quidditch season had begun on saturday harry  would be playing in his first match after weeks of  training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor  won they would move up into second place in the  house championship   hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood  had decided that as their secret weapon harry  should be kept well secret but the news that he was  playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry  didnt know which was worse   people telling him  hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be  running around underneath him holding a mattress        it was really lucky that harry now had hermione as a  friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through  all his homework without her what with all the last  minute quidditch practice wood was making them  do she had also lent him quidditch through the ages  which turned out to be a very interesting read   harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of  committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had  happened during a world cup match in  that  seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players  and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to  happen to them that although people rarely died  playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish  and turn up months later in the sahara desert   hermione had become a bit more relaxed about  breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her  from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for  it the day before harrys first quidditch match the  three of them were out in the freezing courtyard  during break and she had conjured them up a bright  blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar  they were standing with their backs to it getting  warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at  once that snape was limping harry ron and  hermione moved closer together to block the fire from  view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed  unfortunately something about their guilty faces  caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen  the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to  tell them off anyway   whats that youve got there potter   it was quidditch through the ages harry showed him            library books are not to be taken outside the  school said snape give it to me five points from  gryffindor   hes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily  as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with  his leg   dunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron  bitterly   the gryffindor common room was very noisy that  evening harry ron and hermione sat together next  to a window hermione was checking harry and rons  charms homework for them she would never let  them copy how will you learn but by asking her  to read it through they got the right answers anyway   harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the  ages back to take his mind off his nerves about  tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting  up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask  snape if he could have it   better you than me they said together but harry  had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were  other teachers listening   he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked  there was no answer he knocked again nothing   perhaps snape had left the book in there it was  worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered  inside   and a horrible scene met his eyes   snape and filch were inside alone snape was  holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was  bloody and mangled filch was handing snape  bandages          blasted thing snape was saying how are you  supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at  once   harry tried to shut the door quietly but     potter   snape s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his  robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulped   i just wondered if i could have my book back   get out out   harry left before snape could take any more points  from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs   did you get it ron asked as harry joined them  whats the matter   in a low whisper harry told them what hed seen   you know what this means he finished  breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded  dog at halloween thats where he was going when we  saw him   hes after whatever its guarding and id  bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a  diversion   hermiones eyes were wide   no   he wouldnt she said i know hes not very  nice but he wouldnt try and steal something  dumbledore was keeping safe   honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints  or something snapped ron im with harry i            wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he  after whats that dog guarding   harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the  same question neville was snoring loudly but harry  couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind   he  needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch  match in a few hours   but the expression on  snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy  to forget   the next morning dawned very bright and cold the  great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried  sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking  forward to a good quidditch match   youve got to eat some breakfast   i dont want anything   just a bit of toast wheedled hermione   im not hungry   harry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking  onto the field   harry you need your strength said seamus  finnigan seekers are always the ones who get  clobbered by the other team   thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile  ketchup on his sausages   by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out  in the stands around the quidditch pitch many  students had binoculars the seats might be raised  high in the air but it was still difficult to see what  was going on sometimes          ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean  the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for  harry they had painted a large banner on one of the  sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for  president and dean who was good at drawing had  done a large gryffindor lion underneath then  hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that  the paint flashed different colors   meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of  the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch  robes slytherin would be playing in green    wood cleared his throat for silence   okay men he said   and women said chaser angelina johnson   and women wood agreed this is it   the big one said fred weasley   the one weve all been waiting for said george   we know olivers speech by heart fred told harry  we were on the team last year   shut up you two said wood this is the best team  gryffindors had in years were going to win i know  it   he glared at them all as if to say or else   right its time good luck all of you   harry followed fred and george out of the locker  room and hoping his knees werent going to give way  walked onto the field to loud cheers          madam hooch was refereeing she stood in the  middle of the field waiting for the two teams her  broom in her hand   now i want a nice fair game all of you she said  once they were all gathered around her harry noticed  that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the  slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year harry  thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in  him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering  banner high above flashing potter for president over  the crowd his heart skipped he felt braver   mount your brooms please   harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand   madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle   fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they  were off   and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina  johnson of gryffindor   what an excellent chaser  that girl is and rather attractive too      jordan   sorry professor   the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the  commentary for the match closely watched by  professor mcgonagall   and shes really belting along up there a neat pass  to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last  year only a reserve   back to johnson and   no the  slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain  marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes   flint         flying like an eagle up there   hes going to sc no  stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper  wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle   thats  chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive  around flint off up the field and   ouch   that  must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a  bludger   quaffle taken by the slytherins   thats  adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but  hes blocked by a second bludger   sent his way by  fred or george weasley cant tell which   nice play  by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back  in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and  off she goes   shes really flying   dodges a speeding  bludger   the goal posts are ahead   come on now  angelina   keeper bletchley dives   misses    gryffindors score   gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and  moans from the slytherins   budge up there move along   hagrid   ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid  enough space to join them   bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a  large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt  the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch  yet eh   nope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yet   kept outta trouble though thats somethin said  hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at  the speck that was harry            way up above them harry was gliding over the game  squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was  part of his and woods game plan   keep out of the way until you catch sight of the  snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked  before you have to be   when angelina had scored harry had done a couple  of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was  back to staring around for the snitch once he caught  sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection  from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a  bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a  cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and  fred weasley came chasing after it   all right there harry he had time to yell as he  beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint   slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying  chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys  and chaser bell and speeds toward the   wait a  moment   was that the snitch   a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey  dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his  shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left  ear   harry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived  downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker  terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they  hurtled toward the snitch   all the chasers seemed  to have forgotten what they were supposed to be  doing as they hung in midair to watch            harry was faster than higgs   he could see the little  round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead   he  put on an extra spurt of speed     wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors  below   marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose  and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on  for dear life   foul screamed the gryffindors   madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered  a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all  the confusion of course the golden snitch had  disappeared from sight again   down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send  him off ref red card   what are you talking about dean said ron   red card said dean furiously in soccer you get  shown the red card and youre out of the game   but this isnt soccer dean ron reminded him   hagrid however was on deans side   they oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked  harry outta the air   lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides   so   after that obvious and disgusting bit of  cheating      jordan growled professor mcgonagall   i mean after that open and revolting foul             jordan im warning you        all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor  seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a  penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who puts it  away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor  still in possession   it was as harry dodged another bludger which went  spinning dangerously past his head that it happened  his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a  split second he thought he was going to fall he  gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and  knees hed never felt anything like that   it happened again it was as though the broom was  trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands  did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry  tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts    he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout    and then he realized that his broom was completely  out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt  direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and  every now and then making violent swishing  movements that almost unseated him   lee was still commentating   slytherin in possession   flint with the quaffle    passes spinnet   passes bell   hit hard in the face  by a bludger hope it broke his nose   only joking  professor   slytherins score   oh no    the slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have  noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it  was carrying him slowly higher away from the game  jerking and twitching as it went            dunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid  mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i  didn know better id say hed lost control of his  broom  but he cant have    suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over  the stands his broom had started to roll over and  over with him only just managing to hold on then  the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a  wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling  from it holding on with only one hand   did something happen to it when flint blocked him  seamus whispered   cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant  nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful  dark magic   no kid could do that to a nimbus two  thousand   at these words hermione seized hagrid s binoculars  but instead of looking up at harry she started  looking frantically at the crowd   what are you doing moaned ron grayfaced   i knew it hermione gasped snape   look   ron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle  of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on  harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath   hes doing something   jinxing the broom said  hermione   what should we do   leave it to me            before ron could say another word hermione had  disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on  harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost  impossible for him to hang on much longer the  whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the  weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one  of their brooms but it was no good   every time they  got near him the broom would jump higher still they  dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously  hoping to catch him if he fell marcus flint seized the  quaffle and scored five times without anyone  noticing   come on hermione ron muttered desperately   hermione had fought her way across to the stand  where snape stood and was now racing along the row  behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she  knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in  front reaching snape she crouched down pulled  out her wand and whispered a few wellchosen  words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto  the hem of snape s robes   it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize  that he was on fire a sudden yelp told her she had  done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar  in her pocket she scrambled back along the row    snape would never know what had happened   it was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able  to clamber back on to his broom   neville you can look ron said neville had been  sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutes   harry was speeding toward the ground when the  crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though            he was about to be sick   he hit the field on all fours    coughed   and something gold fell into his hand   ive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his  head and the game ended in complete confusion   he didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was  still howling twenty minutes later but it made no  difference   harry hadnt broken any rules and lee  jordan was still happily shouting the results    gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy  points to sixty harry heard none of this though he  was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids  hut with ron and hermione   it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i  saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering  he wouldnt take his eyes off you   rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of  what had gone on next to him in the stands why  would snape do somethin like that   harry ron and hermione looked at one another  wondering what to tell him harry decided on the  truth   i found out something about him he told hagrid  he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on  halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal  whatever its guarding   hagrid dropped the teapot   how do you know about fluffy he said    fluffy             yeah   hes mine   bought him off a greek chappie  i met in the pub las year   i lent him to dumbledore  to guard the      yes said harry eagerly   now dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly  thats top secret that is   but snapes trying to steal it   rubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts  teacher hed do nothin of the sort   so why did he just try and kill harry cried  hermione   the afternoons events certainly seemed to have  changed her mind about snape   i know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all  about them youve got to keep eye contact and  snape wasnt blinking at all i saw him   im tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don  know why harrys broom acted like that but snape  wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all  three of yeh   yer meddlin in things that don  concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an  you forget what its guardin thats between professor  dumbledore an nicolas flamel      aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas  flamel involved is there   hagrid looked furious with himself              the mirror of erised   christmas was coming one morning in mid  december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in  several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the  weasley twins were punished for bewitching several  snowballs so that they followed quirrell around  bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that  managed to battle their way through the stormy sky  to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by  hagrid before they could fly off again   no one could wait for the holidays to start while the  gryffindor common room and the great hall had  roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and  a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms  worst of all were professor snapes classes down in  the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist  before them and they kept as close as possible to  their hot cauldrons   i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions  class for all those people who have to stay at           hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted  at home   he was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and  goyle chuckled harry who was measuring out  powdered spine of lionfish ignored them malfoy had  been even more unpleasant than usual since the  quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had  lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a  widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as  seeker next then hed realized that nobody found  this funny because they were all so impressed at the  way harry had managed to stay on his bucking  broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone  back to taunting harry about having no proper  family   it was true that harry wasnt going back to privet  drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come  around the week before making a list of students  who would be staying for the holidays and harry had  signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at  all this would probably be the best christmas hed  ever had ron and his brothers were staying too  because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania  to visit charlie   when they left the dungeons at the end of potions  they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead  two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a  loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind  it   hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his  head through the branches   nah im all right thanks ron            would you mind moving out of the way came  malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying  to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be  gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i  suppose   that hut of hagrids must seem like a  palace compared to what your familys used to   ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs   weasley   ron let go of the front of malfoys robes   he was provoked professor snape said hagrid  sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree  malfoy was insultin his family   be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules  hagrid said snape silkily five points from  gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more  move along all of you   malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the  tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking   ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys  back one of these days ill get him      i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape   come on cheer up its nearly christmas said  hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the  great hall looks a treat   so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off  to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and  professor flitwick were busy with the christmas  decorations            ah hagrid the last tree   put it in the far corner  would you   the hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and  mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than  twelve towering christmas trees stood around the  room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering  with hundreds of candles   how many days you got left until yer holidays  hagrid asked   just one said hermione and that reminds me    harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we  should be in the library   oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes  away from professor flitwick who had golden  bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing  them over the branches of the new tree   the library said hagrid following them out of the  hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yeh   oh were not working harry told him brightly   ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been  trying to find out who he is   you what hagrid looked shocked listen here    ive told yeh   drop it its nothin to you what that  dogs guardin   we just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats  all said hermione   unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble  harry added we mustve been through hundreds of  books already and we cant find him anywhere   just            give us a hint   i know ive read his name  somewhere   im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly   just have to find out for ourselves then said ron  and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried  off to the library   they had indeed been searching books for flamels  name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how  else were they going to find out what snape was  trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to  know where to begin not knowing what flamel might  have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in  great wizards of the twentieth century or notable  magical names of our time  he was missing too from  important modern magical discoveries and a study of  recent developments in wizardry and then of  course there was the sheer size of the library tens of  thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds  of narrow rows   hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had  decided to search while ron strode off down a row of  books and started pulling them off the shelves at  random harry wandered over to the restricted  section he had been wondering for a while if flamel  wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you  needed a specially signed note from one of the  teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he  knew hed never get one these were the books  containing powerful dark magic never taught at  hogwarts and only read by older students studying  advanced defense against the dark arts   what are you looking for boy   nothing said harry          madam pince the librarian brandished a feather  duster at him   youd better get out then go on   out   wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some  story harry left the library he ron and hermione  had already agreed theyd better not ask madam  pince where they could find flamel they were sure  shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk  snape hearing what they were up to   harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other  two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful  they had been looking for two weeks after all but as  they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt  surprising theyd found nothing what they really  needed was a nice long search without madam pince  breathing down their necks   five minutes later ron and hermione joined him  shaking their heads they went off to lunch   you will keep looking while im away wont you  said hermione and send me an owl if you find  anything   and you could ask your parents if they know who  flamel is said ron itd be safe to ask them   very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione   once the holidays had started ron and harry were  having too good a time to think much about flamel  they had the dormitory to themselves and the  common room was far emptier than usual so they  were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they  sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a  toasting fork   bread english muffins          marshmallows   and plotting ways of getting malfoy  expelled which were fun to talk about even if they  wouldnt work   ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this  was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures  were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in  battle rons set was very old and battered like  everything else he owned it had once belonged to  someone else in his family   in this case his  grandfather however old chessmen werent a  drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had  trouble getting them to do what he wanted   harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had  lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a  very good player yet and they kept shouting different  bits of advice at him which was confusing dont  send me there cant you see his knight send him we  can afford to lose him   on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward  to the next day for the food and the fun but not  expecting any presents at all when he woke early in  the morning however the first thing he saw was a  small pile of packages at the foot of his bed   merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry  scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe   you too said harry will you look at this ive got  some presents   what did you expect turnips said ron turning to  his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrys   harry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in  thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to  harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden          flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry  blew it   it sounded a bit like an owl   a second very small parcel contained a note   we received your message and enclose your christmas  present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped  to the note was a fiftypence piece   thats friendly said harry   ron was fascinated by the fifty pence    weird  he said what a shape this is money   you can keep it said harry laughing at how  pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle    so who sent these   i think i know who that ones from said ron  turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy  parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any  presents and   oh no he groaned shes made you  a weasley sweater   harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand  knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of  homemade fudge   every year she makes us a sweater said ron  unwrapping his own and mines always maroon   thats really nice of her said harry trying the  fudge which was very tasty   his next present also contained candy   a large box  of chocolate frogs from hermione            this only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt  it it was very light he unwrapped it   something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the  floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gasped   ive heard of those he said in a hushed voice  dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten  from hermione if thats what i think it is   theyre  really rare and really valuable   what is it   harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it  was strange to the touch like water woven into  material   its an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on  his face im sure it is   try it on   harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron  gave a yell   it is look down   harry looked down at his feet but they were gone he  dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection  looked back at him just his head suspended in  midair his body completely invisible he pulled the  cloak over his head and his reflection vanished  completely   theres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of  it     harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter  written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen  before were the following words            your father left this in my possession before he died it  is time it was returned to you   use it well   a very merry christmas to you   there was no signature harry stared at the note ron  was admiring the cloak   id give anuthinq for one of these he said anuthinq  whats the matter   nothing said harry he felt very strange who had  sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his  father   before he could say or think anything else the  dormitory door was flung open and fred and george  weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly  out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone  else yet   merry christmas   hey look   harrys got a weasley sweater too   fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one  with a large yellow f on it the other a g   harrys is better than ours though said fred  holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes  more of an effort if youre not family   why arent you wearing yours ron george  demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and  warm            i hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he  pulled it over his head   you havent got a letter on yours george observed   i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but  were not stupid   we know were called gred and  forge   whats all this noise   percy weasley stuck his head through the door  looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway  through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a  lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized   p for prefect get it on percy come on were all  wearing ours even harry got one   i   dont   want    said percy thickly as the twins  forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses  askew   and youre not sitting with the prefects today  either said george christmas is a time for family   they frogmarched percy from the room his arms  pinned to his side by his sweater   harry had never in all his life had such a christmas  dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of  roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas  tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich  gravy and cranberry sauce   and stacks of wizard  crackers every few feet along the table these  fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble  muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their  little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside  harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt  just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and         engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from  the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several  live white mice up at the high table dumbledore  had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered  bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor  flitwick had just read him   flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey  percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle  embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting  redder and redder in the face as he called for more  wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the  cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and  blushed her top hat lopsided   when harry finally left the table he was laden down  with a stack of things out of the crackers including a  pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a grow  yourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess  set the white mice had disappeared and harry had a  nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs  norriss christmas dinner   harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon  having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then  cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the  fire in the gryffindor common room where harry  broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to  ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if  percy hadnt tried to help him so much   after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle  and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy  to do much before bed except sit and watch percy  chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower  because theyd stolen his prefect badge   it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet  something had been nagging at the back of his mind          all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to  think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had  sent it   ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing  mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon  as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry  leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the  cloak out from under it   his fathers  this had been his fathers he let the  material flow over his hands smoother than silk light  as air use it well the note had said   he had to try it now he slipped out of bed and  wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at  his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a  very funny feeling   use it well   suddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of  hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement  flooded through him as he stood there in the dark  and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere  and filch would never know   ron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him  something held him back   his fathers cloak   he  felt that this time   the first time   he wanted to use  it alone   he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across  the common room and climbed through the portrait  hole   whos there squawked the fat lady harry said  nothing he walked quickly down the corridor            where should he go he stopped his heart racing  and thought and then it came to him the restricted  section in the library hed be able to read as long as  he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel  was he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight  around him as he walked   the library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a  lamp to see his way along the rows of books the  lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and  even though harry could feel his arm supporting it  the sight gave him the creeps   the restricted section was right at the back of the  library stepping carefully over the rope that  separated these books from the rest of the library he  held up his lamp to read the titles   they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold  letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt  understand some had no title at all one book had a  dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the  hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he  was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint  whispering was coming from the books as though  they knew someone was there who shouldnt be   he had to start somewhere setting the lamp down  carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom  shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black  and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out  with difficulty because it was very heavy and  balancing it on his knee let it fall open   a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence    the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but  the shriek went on and on one high unbroken  earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked  over his lamp which went out at once panicking he         heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside    stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran  for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale  wild eyes looked straight through him and harry  slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked  off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in  his ears   he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of  armor he had been so busy getting away from the  library he hadnt paid attention to where he was  going perhaps because it was dark he didnt  recognize where he was at all there was a suit of  armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be  five floors above there   you asked me to come directly to you professor if  anyone was wandering around at night and  somebodys been in the library   restricted section   harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he  was filch must know a shortcut because his soft  greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it  was snape who replied the restricted section well  they cant be far well catch them   harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape  came around the corner ahead they couldnt see  him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if  they came much nearer theyd knock right into him    the cloak didnt stop him from being solid   he backed away as quietly as he could a door stood  ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed  through it holding his breath trying not to move it  and to his relief he managed to get inside the room  without their noticing anything they walked straight  past and harry leaned against the wall breathing  deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that         had been close very close it was a few seconds  before he noticed anything about the room he had  hidden in     it looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes  of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and  there was an upturned wastepaper basket   but  propped against the wall facing him was something  that didnt look as if it belonged there something that  looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it  out of the way   it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling  with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed  feet there was an inscription carved around the top  erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi   his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch  and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror  wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again  he stepped in front of it   he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself  from screaming he whirled around his heart was  pounding far more furiously than when the book had  screamed   for he had seen not only himself in the  mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right  behind him   but the room was empty breathing very fast he  turned slowly back to the mirror   there he was reflected in it white and scared  looking and there reflected behind him were at least  ten others harry looked over his shoulder   but still  no one was there or were they all invisible too was  he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this  mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or  not          he looked in the mirror again a woman standing  right behind his reflection was smiling at him and  waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind  him if she was really there hed touch her their  reflections were so close together but he felt only air    she and the others existed only in the mirror   she was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair  and her eyes   her eyes are just like mine harry  thought edging a little closer to the glass bright  green   exactly the same shape but then he noticed  that she was crying smiling but crying at the same  time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next  to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and  his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just  as harrys did   harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose  was nearly touching that of his reflection   mom he whispered dad   they just looked at him smiling and slowly harry  looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror  and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses  like his even a little old man who looked as though  he had harrys knobbly knees   harry was looking at  his family for the first time in his life   the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared  hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against  the glass as though he was hoping to fall right  through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of  ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness   how long he stood there he didnt know the  reflections did not fade and he looked and looked  until a distant noise brought him back to his senses  he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to          bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face  whispered ill come back and hurried from the  room   you could have woken me up said ron crossly   you can come tonight im going back i want to show  you the mirror   id like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly   and i want to see all your family all the weasleys  youll be able to show me your other brothers and  everyone   you can see them any old time said ron just  come round my house this summer anyway maybe  it only shows dead people shame about not finding  flamel though have some bacon or something why  arent you eating anything   harry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and  would be seeing them again tonight he had almost  forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important  anymore who cared what the threeheaded dog was  guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really   are you all right said ron you look odd   what harry feared most was that he might not be  able to find the mirror room again with ron covered  in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly  the next night they tried retracing harrys route from  the library wandering around the dark passageways  for nearly an hour   im freezing said ron lets forget it and go back   ivo harry hissed i know its here somewhere          they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the  opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron  started moaning that his feet were dead with cold  harry spotted the suit of armor   its here   just here   yes   they pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak  from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror   there they were his mother and father beamed at the  sight of him   see harry whispered   i cant see anything   look look at them all  there are loads of them   i can only see you   look in it properly go on stand where i am   harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the  mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron  in his paisley pajamas   ron though was staring transfixed at his image  look at me he said   can you see all your family standing around you   no   im alone   but im different   i look older    and im head boy   what            i am   im wearing the badge like bill used to   and  im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup    im quidditch captain too   ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to  look excitedly at harry   do you think this mirror shows the future   how can it all my family are dead   let me have  another look      you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit  more time   youre only holding the quidditch cup whats  interesting about that i want to see my parents   dont push me      a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to  their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they  had been talking   quick   ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous  eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and  harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing    did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an  age she turned and left   this isnt safe   she might have gone for filch i bet  she heard us come on   and ron pulled harry out of the room   the snow still hadnt melted the next morning            want to play chess harry said ron     no   why dont we go down and visit hagrid   no  you go    i know what youre thinking about harry that  mirror dont go back tonight   why not   i dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it   and  anyway youve had too many close shaves already  filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around  so what if they cant see you what if they walk into  you what if you knock something over   you sound like hermione   im serious harry dont go   but harry only had one thought in his head which  was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt  going to stop him   that third night he found his way more quickly than  before he was walking so fast he knew he was  making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet  anyone   and there were his mother and father smiling at him  again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily  harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the  mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying  here all night with his family nothing at all   except            so   back again harry   harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he  looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the  wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry  must have walked straight past him so desperate to  get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him   i   i didnt see you sir   strange how nearsighted being invisible can make  you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see  that he was smiling   so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on  the floor with harry you like hundreds before you  have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised   i didnt know it was called that sir   but i expect youve realized by now what it does   it   well   it shows me my family      and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy   how did you know      i dont need a cloak to become invisible said  dumbledore gently now can you think what the  mirror of erised shows us all   harry shook his head   let me explain the happiest man on earth would be  able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror  that is he would look into it and see himself exactly  as he is does that help            harry thought then he said slowly it shows us  what we want  whatever we want    yes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us  nothing more or less than the deepest most  desperate desire of our hearts you who have never  known your family see them standing around you  ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed  by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best  of all of them however this mirror will give us  neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away  before it entranced by what they have seen or been  driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or  even possible   the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow  harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if  you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it  does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live  remember that now why dont you put that  admirable cloak back on and get off to bed   harry stood up   sir   professor dumbledore can i ask you  something   obviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled  you may ask me one more thing however   what do you see when you look in the mirror   i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks   harry stared   one can never have enough socks said  dumbledore another christmas has come and gone            and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on  giving me books   it was only when he was back in bed that it struck  harry that dumbledore might not have been quite  truthful but then he thought as he shoved  scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal  question              nicholas flambl   dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking  for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the  christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed  folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he  could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily  but he couldnt he started having nightmares over  and over again he dreamed about his parents  disappearing in a flash of green light while a high  voice cackled with laughter   you see dumbledore was right that mirror could  drive you mad said ron when harry told him about  these dreams   hermione who came back the day before term  started took a different view of things she was torn  between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed  roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had  caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at  least found out who nicolas flamel was           they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel  in a library book even though harry was still sure  hed read the name somewhere once term had  started they were back to skimming through books  for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even  less time than the other two because quidditch  practice had started again   wood was working the team harder than ever even  the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt  dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that  wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on  woods side if they won their next match against  hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the  house championship for the first time in seven years  quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he  had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after  training   then during one particularly wet and muddy practice  session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed  just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept  divebombing each other and pretending to fall off  their brooms   will you stop messing around he yelled thats  exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match  snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for  any excuse to knock points off gryffindor   george weasley really did fall off his broom at these  words    snapes refereeing he spluttered through a  mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a  quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might  overtake slytherin            the rest of the team landed next to george to  complain too   its not my fault said wood weve just got to make  sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an  excuse to pick on us   which was all very well thought harry but he had  another reason for not wanting snape near him while  he was playing quidditch    the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another  as usual at the end of practice but harry headed  straight back to the gryffindor common room where  he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was  the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry  and ron thought was very good for her   dont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry  sat down next to him i need to concern he caught  sight of harrys face whats the matter with you   you look terrible   speaking quietly so that no one else would hear   harry told the other two about snape s sudden  sinister desire to be a quidditch referee   dont play said hermione at once   say youre ill said ron   pretend to break your leg hermione suggested    really break your leg said ron   i cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i  back out gryffindor cant play at all            at that moment neville toppled into the common  room how he had managed to climb through the  portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs  had been stuck together with what they recognized at  once as the leglocker curse he must have had to  bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower   everyone fell over laughing except hermione who  leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles  legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling   what happened hermione asked him leading him  over to sit with harry and ron   malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the  library he said hed been looking for someone to  practice that on   go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged  neville report him   neville shook his head   i dont want more trouble he mumbled   youve got to stand up to him neville said ron  hes used to walking all over people but thats no  reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier   theres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be  in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville  choked out   harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a  chocolate frog the very last one from the box  hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to  neville who looked as though he might cry            youre worth twelve of malfoy harry said the  sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and  wheres malfoy in stinking slytherin   nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he  unwrapped the frog   thanks harry  i think ill go to bed  dyou want  the card you collect them dont you   as neville walked away harry looked at the famous  wizard card   dumbledore again he said he was the first one i  ever      he gasped he stared at the back of the card then he  looked up at ron and hermione   ive found him he whispered ive found flamel i  told you id read the name somewhere before i read it  on the train coming here   listen to this   dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of  the dark wizard grindelwald in  for the  discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his  work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamelv   hermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so  excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their  very first piece of homework   stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs  to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had  time to exchange mystified looks before she was  dashing back an enormous old book in her arms   i never thought to look in here she whispered  excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a  bit of light reading          light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet  until shed looked something up and started flicking  frantically through the pages muttering to herself   at last she found what she was looking for   i knew it i knew it   are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily  hermione ignored him   nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the  only known maker of the sorcerers stone   this didnt have quite the effect shed expected   the what said harry and ron   oh honestly  dont you two read look   read that  there   she pushed the book toward them and harry and  ron read   the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with  making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance  with astonishing powers the stone will transform  any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of  life which will make the drinker immortal   there have been many reports of the sorcerers stone  over the centuries but the only stone currently in  existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted  alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated  his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year  enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle  six hundred and fiftyeight            see said hermione when harry and ron had  finished the dog must be guarding flamels  sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep  it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew  someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone  moved out of gringotts   a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever  dying said harry no wonder snapes after it   anyone would want it   and no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study  of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes  not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is  he   the next morning in defense against the dark arts  while copying down different ways of treating werewolf  bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd  do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt  until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that  harry remembered about snape and the coming  match   im going to play he told ron and hermione if i  dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared  to face snape ill show them  itll really wipe the  smiles off their faces if we win   just as long as were not wiping you off the field  said hermione   as the match drew nearer however harry became  more and more nervous whatever he told ron and  hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm  either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house  championship was wonderful no one had done it for  seven years but would they be allowed to with such  a biased referee          harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not  but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever  he went at times he even wondered whether snape  was following him trying to catch him on his own  potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly  torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape  possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers  stone harry didnt see how he could   yet he  sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could  read minds   harry knew when they wished him good luck  outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron  and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever  see him alive again this wasnt what youd call  comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep  talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked  up his nimbus two thousand   ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in  the stands next to neville who couldnt understand  why they looked so grim and worried or why they had  both brought their wands to the match little did  harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly  practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the  idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready  to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to  hurt harry   now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione  muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve   i know ron snapped dont nag   back in the locker room wood had taken harry  aside   dont want to pressure you potter but if we ever  need an early capture of the snitch its now finish          the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too  much   the whole schools out there said fred weasley  peering out of the door even   blimey    dumbledores come to watch   harrys heart did a somersault   dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make  sure fred was right there was no mistaking that  silver beard   harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was  safe there was simply no way that snape would dare  to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching   perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as  the teams marched onto the field something that ron  noticed too   ive never seen snape look so mean he told  hermione look   theyre off ouch   someone had poked ron in the back of the head it  was malfoy   oh sorry weasley didnt see you there   malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle   wonder how long potters going to stay on his broom  this time anyone want a bet what about you  weasley   ron didnt answer snape had just awarded  hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit  a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers  crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry          who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the  snitch   you know how i think they choose people for the  gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes  later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty  for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for   see theres potter whos got no parents then theres  the weasleys whove got no money   you should be  on the team longbottom youve got no brains   neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face  malfoy   im worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered   malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but  ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game  said you tell him neville   longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than  weasley and thats saying something   rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking  point with anxiety about harry   im warning you malfoy   one more word      ron said hermione suddenly harry      what where   harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive  which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd  hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth  as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet   youre in luck weasley potters obviously spotted  some money on the ground said malfoy          ron snapped before malfoy knew what was  happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to  the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the  back of his seat to help   come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto  her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape    she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around  under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from  the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle   up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in  time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing  him by inches   the next second harry had pulled  out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch  clasped in his hand   the stands erupted it had to be a record no one  could ever remember the snitch being caught so  quickly   ron ron where are you the games over harrys  won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked  hermione dancing up and down on her seat and  hugging parvati patil in the row in front   harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground  he couldnt believe it hed done it   the game was  over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors  came spilling onto the field he saw snape land  nearby whitefaced and tightlipped   then harry felt  a hand on his shoulder and looked up into  dumbledores smiling face   well done said dumbledore quietly so that only  harry could hear nice to see you havent been  brooding about that mirror    been keeping busy     excellent             snape spat bitterly on the ground     jc jc jc     harry left the locker room alone some time later to  take his nimbus two thousand back to the  broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling  happier hed really done something to be proud of  now   no one could say he was just a famous name  any more the evening air had never smelled so  sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the  last hour in his head which was a happy blur  gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders  ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and  down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed   harry had reached the shed he leaned against the  wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its  windows glowing red in the setting sun gryffindor in  the lead hed done it hed shown snape    and speaking of snape      a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of  the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked  as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest  harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched  he recognized the figures prowling walk snape  sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at  dinner   what was going on   harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand  and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw  snape enter the forest at a run he followed   the trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape  had gone he flew in circles lower and lower  brushing the top branches of trees until he heard            voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly  in a towering beech tree   he climbed carefully along one of the branches  holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through  the leaves   below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he  wasnt alone quirrell was there too harry couldnt  make out the look on his face but he was stuttering  worse than ever harry strained to catch what they  were saying    ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of  all pplaces severus    oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his  voice icy students arent supposed to know about  the sorcerers stone after all   harry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling  something snape interrupted him   have you found out how to get past that beast of  hagrids yet   bbbut severus i      you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said  snape taking a step toward him   ii dont know what you      you know perfectly well what i mean   an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the  tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say      your little bit of hocuspocus im waiting            bbut i dddont        very well snape cut in well have another little  chat soon when youve had time to think things over  and decided where your loyalties lie   he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the  clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see  quirrell standing quite still as though he was  petrified     jc jc jc     harry where have you been hermione squeaked   we won you won we won shouted ron thumping  harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye  and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single  handed hes still out cold but madam pomfrey says  hell be all right   talk about showing slytherin  everyones waiting for you in the common room were  having a party fred and george stole some cakes and  stuff from the kitchens   never mind that now said harry breathlessly lets  find an empty room you wait til you hear this    he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting  the door behind them then he told them what hed  seen and heard   so we were right it is the sorcerers stone and  snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he  asked if he knew how to get past fluffy   and he said  something about quirrells hocuspocus   i reckon  there are other things guarding the stone apart from  fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell            would have done some antidark arts spell that  snape needs to break through      so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell  stands up to snape said hermione in alarm   itll be gone by next tuesday said ron              norbert the norwegian  ridgeback   quirrell however must have been braver than theyd  thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be  getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though  hed cracked yet   every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry  ron and hermione would press their ears to the door  to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape  was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which  surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever  harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an  encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling  people off for laughing at quirrells stutter   hermione however had more on her mind than the  sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study  schedules and colorcoding all her notes harry and  ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging  them to do the same           hermione the exams are ages away   ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages  thats like a second to nicolas flamel   but were not six hundred years old ron reminded  her anyway what are you studying for you already  know it all   what am i studying for are you crazy you realize  we need to pass these exams to get into the second  year theyre very important i should have started  studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into  me   unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking  along the same lines as hermione they piled so  much homework on them that the easter holidays  werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it  was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting  the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand  movements moaning and yawning harry and ron  spent most of their free time in the library with her  trying to get through all their extra work   ill never remember this ron burst out one  afternoon throwing down his quill and looking  longingly out of the library window it was the first  really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a  clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in  the air of summer coming   harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand  magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he  heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the  library            hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind  his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin  overcoat   jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their  interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he  looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer  nicolas flamel are yeh   oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron  impressively and we know what that dogs guarding  its a sorcerers st      shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if  anyone was listening don go shoutin about it  whats the matter with yeh   there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a  matter of fact said harry about whats guarding  the stone apart from fluffy      shhhh said hagrid again listen   come an see  me later im not promisin ill tell yeh anythin mind  but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren  spposed ter know theyll think ive told yeh      see you later then said harry   hagrid shuffled off   what was he hiding behind his back said  hermione thoughtfully   do you think it had anything to do with the stone   im going to see what section he was in said ron  whod had enough of working he came back a  minute later with a pile of books in his arms and  slammed them down on the table          dragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff  about dragons look at these dragon species of great  britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon  keepers guide   hagrid s always wanted a dragon he told me so the  first time i ever met him said harry   but its against our laws said ron dragon  breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention  of  everyone knows that its hard to stop  muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in  the back garden   anyway you cant tame dragons  its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got  off wild ones in romania   but there arent wild dragons in britain said harry   of course there are said ron common welsh  green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic  has a job hushing them up i can tell you our kind  have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted  them to make them forget   so what on earths hagrid up to said hermione   when they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers  hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all  the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it  before he let them in and then shut the door quickly  behind them   it was stifling hot inside even though it was such a  warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate   hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat  sandwiches which they refused   so   yeh wanted to ask me somethin            yes said harry there was no point beating around  the bush we were wondering if you could tell us  whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from  fluffy   hagrid frowned at him   o course i cant he said number one i don know  meself number two yeh know too much already so i  wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good  reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts   i  sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how  yeh even know abou fluffy   oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us  but you do know you know everything that goes on  round here said hermione in a warm flattering  voice hagrid s beard twitched and they could tell he  was smiling we only wondered who had done the  guarding really hermione went on we wondered  who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him  apart from you   hagrid s chest swelled at these last words harry and  ron beamed at hermione   well i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that   lets see  he borrowed fluffy from me  then some  o the teachers did enchantments  professor sprout    professor flitwick   professor mcgonagall    he  ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell    an dumbledore himself did somethin o course   hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor  snape   snape            yeah   yer not still on abou that are yeh look  snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter  steal it   harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the  same as he was if snape had been in on protecting  the stone it must have been easy to find out how the  other teachers had guarded it he probably knew  everything   except it seemed quirrells spell and  how to get past fluffy   youre the only one who knows how to get past  fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously   and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even  one of the teachers   not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said  hagrid proudly   well thats something harry muttered to the  others hagrid can we have a window open im  boiling   cant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him  glance at the fire harry looked at it too   hagrid   whats that   but he already knew what it was in the very heart of  the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg   ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard  thats   er    where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching  over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve  cost you a fortune            won it said hagrid las night i was down in the  village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards  with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of  it ter be honest   but what are you going to do with it when its  hatched said hermione   well ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling  a large book from under his pillow got this outta the  library   dragon breeding for pleasure and profit    its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep  the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on  em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o  brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an  see here   how ter recognize diffrent eggs   what i  got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare  them   he looked very pleased with himself but hermione  didnt   hagrid you live in a wooden house she said   but hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily  as he stoked the fire   so now they had something else to worry about what  might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was  hiding an illegal dragon in his hut   wonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron  sighed as evening after evening they struggled  through all the extra homework they were getting  hermione had now started making study schedules  for harry and ron too it was driving them nuts            then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry  another note from hagrid he had written only two  words its hatching   ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to  the hut hermione wouldnt hear of it   hermione how many times in our lives are we going  to see a dragon hatching   weve got lessons well get into trouble and thats  nothing to what hagrid s going to be in when someone  finds out what hes doing      shut up harry whispered   malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped  dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt  like the look on malfoys face at all   ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology  and in the end hermione agreed to run down to  hagrids with the other two during morning break  when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of  their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels  at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge  of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed  and excited   its nearly out he ushered them inside   the egg was lying on the table there were deep  cracks in it something was moving inside a funny  clicking noise was coming from it   they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched  with bated breath            all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg  split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it  wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a  crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge  compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout  with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging  orange eyes   it sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snout   isnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached  out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at  his fingers showing pointed fangs   bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid   hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian  ridgebacks grow exactly   hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly  drained from his face   he leapt to his feet and ran to  the window   whats the matter   someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains    its a kid   hes runnin back up ter the school   harry bolted to the door and looked out even at a  distance there was no mistaking him   malfoy had seen the dragon   something about the smile lurking on malfoys face  during the next week made harry ron and hermione  very nervous they spent most of their free time in  hagrid s darkened hut trying to reason with him   just let him go harry urged set him free          i cant said hagrid hes too little hed die     they looked at the dragon it had grown three times  in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its  nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping  duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy  there were empty brandy bottles and chicken  feathers all over the floor   ive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking  at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me  now watch norbert norbert wheres mommy   hes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys ear   hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and  norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy  could go to dumbledore at any moment   hagrid bit his lip   i   i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus  dump him cant   harry suddenly turned to ron   charlie he said   youre losing it too said ron im ron remember   no   charlie   your brother charlie in romania  studying dragons we could send norbert to him  charlie can take care of him and then put him back  in the wild   brilliant said ron how about it hagrid   and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send  an owl to charlie to ask him          the following week dragged by wednesday night  found hermione and harry sitting alone in the  common room long after everyone else had gone to  bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight  when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out  of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak  he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed  norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate   it bit me he said showing them his hand which  was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going  to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that  dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but  the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a  fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off  for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a  lullaby   there was a tap on the dark window   its hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell  have charlies answer   the three of them put their heads together to read the  note   dear ron   how are you thanks for the letter   id be glad to  take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy  getting him here i think the best thing will be to send  him over with some friends of mine who are coming to  visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen  carrying an illegal dragon   could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at  midnight on saturday they can meet you there and  take him away while its still dark            send me an answer as soon as possible     love   charlie   they looked at one another   weve got the invisibility cloak said harry it  shouldnt be too difficult   i think the cloaks big  enough to cover two of us and norbert   it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that  the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of  norbert   and malfoy   there was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten  hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt  know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey    would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon  though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty  shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were  poisonous   harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing  at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in  bed   its not just my hand he whispered although that  feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam  pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he  could come and have a good laugh at me he kept  threatening to tell her what really bit me   ive told  her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me   i  shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats  why hes doing this   harry and hermione tried to calm ron down          itll all be over at midnight on saturday said  hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the  contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat   midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice   oh no   oh no   ive just remembered   charlies  letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to  know were getting rid of norbert   harry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer  madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made  them leave saying ron needed sleep   its too late to change the plan now harry told  hermione we havent got time to send charlie  another owl and this could be our only chance to get  rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got  the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about  that   they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a  bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who  opened a window to talk to them   i wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky  stage   nothin i cant handle   when they told him about charlies letter his eyes  filled with tears although that might have been  because norbert had just bitten him on the leg   aargh its all right he only got my boot   jus  playin   hes only a baby after all   the baby banged its tail on the wall making the  windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to  the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly  enough            they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time  came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt  been so worried about what they had to do it was a  very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late  arriving at hagrid s hut because theyd had to wait for  peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall  where hed been playing tennis against the wall   hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate   hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey  said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his  teddy bear in case he gets lonely   from inside the crate came ripping noises that  sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his  head torn off   byebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and  hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak  and stepped underneath it themselves mommy will  never forget you   how they managed to get the crate back up to the  castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as  they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the  entrance hall and along the dark corridors up  another staircase then another   even one of harrys  shortcuts didnt make the work much easier   nearly there harry panted as they reached the  corridor beneath the tallest tower   then a sudden movement ahead of them made them  almost drop the crate forgetting that they were  already invisible they shrank into the shadows  staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling  with each other ten feet away a lamp flared            professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair  net had malfoy by the ear     detention she shouted and twenty points from  slytherin wandering around in the middle of the  night how dare you      you dont understand professor harry potters  coming   hes got a dragon   what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies  come on   i shall see professor snape about you  malfoy   the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower  seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not  until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did  they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe  properly again hermione did a sort of jig   malfoys got detention i could sing   dont harry advised her   chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert  thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later  four broomsticks came swooping down out of the  darkness   charlies friends were a cheery lot they showed  harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so  they could suspend norbert between them they all  helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry  and hermione shook hands with the others and  thanked them very much   at last norbert was going  going  gone            they slipped back down the spiral staircase their  hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was  off them no more dragon   malfoy in detention    what could spoil their happiness   the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the  stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face  loomed suddenly out of the darkness   well well well he whispered we are in trouble   theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower                the forbidden forest   things couldnt have been worse   filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls  study on the first floor where they sat and waited  without saying a word to each other hermione was  trembling excuses alibis and wild coverup stories  chased each other around harrys brain each more  feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were  going to get out of trouble this time they were  cornered how could they have been so stupid as to  forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that  professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out  of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of  night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower  which was outofbounds except for classes add  norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as  well be packing their bags already   had harry thought that things couldnt have been  worse he was wrong when professor mcgonagall  appeared she was leading neville           harry neville burst out the moment he saw the  other two i was trying to find you to warn you i  heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he  said you had a drag      harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but  professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more  likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over  the three of them   i would never have believed it of any of you mr filch  says you were up in the astronomy tower its one  oclock in the morning explain yourselves   it was the first time hermione had ever failed to  answer a teachers question she was staring at her  slippers as still as a statue   i think ive got a good idea of whats been going on  said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius  to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockand  bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed  and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose  you think its funny that longbottom here heard the  story and believed it too   harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him  without words that this wasnt true because neville  was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering  neville   harry knew what it must have cost him to  try and find them in the dark to warn them   im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four  students out of bed in one night ive never heard of  such a thing before you miss granger i thought you  had more sense as for you mr potter i thought  gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of  you will receive detentions   yes you too mr  longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk         around school at night especially these days its very  dangerous   and fifty points will be taken from  gryffindor   fifty harry gasped   they would lose the lead the  lead hed won in the last quidditch match   fifty points each said professor mcgonagall  breathing heavily through her long pointed nose   professor   please      you cant    dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get  back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed  of gryffindor students   a hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in  last place in one night theyd ruined any chance  gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as  though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach  how could they ever make up for this   harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville  sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours  harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort  him he knew neville like himself was dreading the  dawn what would happen when the rest of  gryffindor found out what theyd done   at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses  that recorded the house points the next day thought  there d been a mistake how could they suddenly  have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday  and then the story started to spread harry potter  the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch  matches had lost them all those points him and a  couple of other stupid first years          from being one of the most popular and admired  people at the school harry was suddenly the most  hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on  him because everyone had been longing to see  slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry  went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their  voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other  hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and  cheering thanks potter we owe you one   only ron stood by him   theyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george  have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been  here and people still like them   theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one  go though have they said harry miserably   well   no ron admitted   it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry  swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent  his business from now on hed had it with sneaking  around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that  he went to wood and offered to resign from the  quidditch team   resign wood thundered what goodll that do   how are we going to get any points back if we cant  win at quidditch   but even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the  team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if  they had to speak about him they called him the  seeker   hermione and neville were suffering too they didnt  have as bad a time as harry because they werent as          wellknown but nobody would speak to them either  hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in  class keeping her head down and working in silence   harry was almost glad that the exams werent far  away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off  his misery he ron and hermione kept to  themselves working late into the night trying to  remember the ingredients in complicated potions  learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates  of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions    then about a week before the exams were due to  start harrys new resolution not to interfere in  anything that didnt concern him was put to an  unexpected test walking back from the library on his  own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering  from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he  heard quirrells voice   no   no   not again please      it sounded as though someone was threatening him  harry moved closer   all right   all right    he heard quirrell sob   next second quirrell came hurrying out of the  classroom straightening his turban he was pale and  looked as though he was about to cry he strode out  of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed  him he waited until quirrells footsteps had  disappeared then peered into the classroom it was  empty but a door stood ajar at the other end harry  was halfway toward it before he remembered what  hed promised himself about not meddling   all the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers  stones that snape had just left the room and from          what harry had just heard snape would be walking  with a new spring in his step   quirrell seemed to  have given in at last   harry went back to the library where hermione was  testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed  heard   snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told  him how to break his antidark force spell      theres still fluffy though said hermione   maybe snapes found out how to get past him  without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the  thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a  book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a  giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry   the light of adventure was kindling again in rons  eyes but hermione answered before harry could   go to dumbledore thats what we should have done  ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown  out for sure   but weve got no proof said harry quirrells too  scared to back us up snapes only got to say he  doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and  that he was nowhere near the third floor   who do  you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a  secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it  up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life  depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the  more students get thrown out the better hell think  and dont forget were not supposed to know about  the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaining   hermione looked convinced but ron didnt          if we just do a bit of poking around        no said harry flatly weve done enough poking  around   he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to  learn the names of its moons   the following morning notes were delivered to harry  hermione and neville at the breakfast table they  were all the same   your detention will take place at eleven oclock  tonight   meet mr filch in the entrance hall   professor m mcgonagall   harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in  the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected  hermione to complain that this was a whole night of  studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry  she felt they deserved what theyd got   at eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron  in the common room and went down to the entrance  hall with neville filch was already there   and so  was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had  gotten a detention too   follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading  them outside   i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule  again wont you eh he said leering at them oh  yes    hard work and pain are the best teachers if you  ask me  its just a pity they let the old  punishments die out    hang you by your wrists from         the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in  my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever  needed  right off we go and dont think of running  off now itll be worse for you if you do   they marched off across the dark grounds neville  kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment  was going to be it must be something really horrible  or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted   the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it  kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry  could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then  they heard a distant shout   is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started   harrys heart rose if they were going to be working  with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must  have showed in his face because filch said i  suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with  that oaf well think again boy   its into the forest  youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come  out in one piece   at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy  stopped dead in his tracks   the forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite  as cool as usual we cant go in there at night    theres all sorts of things in there   werewolves i  heard   neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a  choking noise   thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice  cracking with glee shouldve thought of them  werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you          hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark  fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow  and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder   abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour  already all right harry hermione   i shouldnt be too friendly to them hagrid said  filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all   thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at  filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do  that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here   ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left of  them he added nastily and he turned and started  back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the  darkness   malfoy now turned to hagrid   im not going in that forest he said and harry was  pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice   yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said  hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got  ter pay fer it   but this is servant stuff its not for students to do i  thought wed be copying lines or something if my  father knew i was doing this hed         tell yer thats how it is at hogwarts hagrid  growled copyin lines what goods that ter anyone  yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think  yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back  off ter the castle an pack go on            malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but  then dropped his gaze   right then said hagrid now listen carefully   cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an  i don want no one takin risks follow me over here a  moment   he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his  lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding  earth track that disappeared into the thick black  trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked  into the forest   look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on  the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood  theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat  this is the second time in a week i found one dead  last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor  thing we might have ter put it out of its misery   and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us  first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his  voice   theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh  if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the  path right now were gonna split inter two parties  an follow the trail in diffrent directions theres blood  all over the place it mustve bin staggerin around  since last night at least   i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fangs  long teeth   all right but i warn yeh hes a coward said hagrid  so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco  neville an fangll go the other now if any of us  finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right          get yer wands out an practice now   thats it   an  if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well  all come an find yeh   so be careful   lets go   the forest was black and silent a little way into it  they reached a fork in the earth path and harry  hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy  neville and fang took the right   they walked in silence their eyes on the ground  every now and then a ray of moonlight through the  branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the  fallen leaves   harry saw that hagrid looked very worried    could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry  asked   not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch  a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never  knew one ter be hurt before   they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could  hear running water there must be a stream  somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn  blood here and there along the winding path   you all right hermione hagrid whispered don  worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an  then well be able ter   get behind that tree   hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them  off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an  arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready  to fire the three of them listened something was  slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a  cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting            up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound  faded away   i knew it he murmured theres summat in here  that shouldn be   a werewolf harry suggested   that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn  neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but  careful now   they walked more slowly ears straining for the  faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead  something definitely moved   whos there hagrid called show yerself   im  armed   and into the clearing came   was it a man or a  horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard  but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body  with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws  dropped   oh its you ronan said hagrid in relief how are  yeh   he walked forward and shook the centaurs hand   good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a  deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me   cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his  crossbow theres summat bad loose in this forest  this is harry potter an hermione granger by the  way students up at the school an this is ronan  you two hes a centaur            wed noticed said hermione faintly     good evening said ronan students are you and  do you learn much up at the school   erm      a bit said hermione timidly   a bit well thats something ronan sighed he  flung back his head and stared at the sky mars is  bright tonight   yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad  weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn  bin hurt   you seen anythin   ronan didnt answer immediately he stared  unblinkingly upward then sighed again   always the innocent are the first victims he said   so it has been for ages past so it is now   yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin  ronan anythin unusual   mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while  hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright   yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit  nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed  anythin strange   yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he  said the forest hides many secrets   a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid  raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur          blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than  ronan     hullo bane said hagrid all right   good evening hagrid i hope you are well   well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you  seen anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn  bin injured   would yeh know anythin about it   bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked  skyward   mars is bright tonight he said simply   weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of  you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be  off then   harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing  staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until  the trees blocked their view   never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight  answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not  interested in anythin closern the moon   are there many of them in here asked hermione   oh a fair few    keep themselves to themselves  mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if  ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs   they know things  jus don let on much   dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier  said harry            did that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask  me that was whats bin killin the unicorns   never  heard anythin like it before   they walked on through the dense dark trees harry  kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the  nasty feeling they were being watched he was very  glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them  they had just passed a bend in the path when  hermione grabbed hagrid s arm   hagrid look red sparks the others are in trouble   you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the  path ill come back for yeh   they heard him crashing away through the  undergrowth and stood looking at each other very  scared until they couldnt hear anything but the  rustling of leaves around them   you dont think theyve been hurt do you  whispered hermione   i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got  neville  its our fault hes here in the first place   the minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper  than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every  sigh of the wind every cracking twig what was going  on where were the others   at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids  return malfoy neville and fang were with him  hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked  up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville  had panicked and sent up the sparks            well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket  you two were makin right were changin groups    neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go  with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a  whisper to harry but hell have a harder time  frightenin you an weve gotta get this done   so harry set off into the heart of the forest with  malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an  hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path  became almost impossible to follow because the trees  were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be  getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a  tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing  around in pain close by harry could see a clearing  ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient  oak   look    he murmured holding out his arm to stop  malfoy   something bright white was gleaming on the ground  they inched closer   it was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry  had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its  long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where  it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on  the dark leaves   harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering  sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on  the edge of the clearing quivered  then out of the  shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the  ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and  fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the  unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the  animals side and began to drink its blood            aaaaaaaaaaargh       malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted   so did  fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked  right at harry   unicorn blood was dribbling down its  front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry    he couldnt move for fear   then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his  head it was as though his scar were on fire half  blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves  behind him galloping and something jumped clean  over harry charging at the figure   the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his  knees it took a minute or two to pass when he  looked up the figure had gone a centaur was  standing over him not ronan or bane this one  looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a  palomino body   are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to  his feet   yes   thank you   what was that   the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue  eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at  harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out  livid on harrys forehead   you are the potter boy he said you had better get  back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time    especially for you can you ride it will be quicker  this way   my name is firenze he added as he lowered  himself on to his front legs so that harry could  clamber onto his back          there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from  the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came  bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and  sweaty   firenze bane thundered what are you doing you  have a human on your back have you no shame are  you a common mule   do you realize who this is said firenze this is the  potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the  better   what have you been telling him growled bane  remember firenze we are sworn not to set  ourselves against the heavens have we not read what  is to come in the movements of the planets   ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze  thought he was acting for the best he said in his  gloomy voice   bane kicked his back legs in anger   for the best what is that to do with us centaurs  are concerned with what has been foretold it is not  our business to run around like donkeys after stray  humans in our forest   firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger  so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on   do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at  bane do you not understand why it was killed or  have the planets not let you in on that secret i set  myself against what is lurking in this forest bane  yes with humans alongside me if i must            and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on  as best he could they plunged off into the trees  leaving ronan and bane behind them   harry didnt have a clue what was going on   whys bane so angry he asked what was that  thing you saved me from anyway   firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his  head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did  not answer harrys question they made their way  through the trees in silence for so long that harry  thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore  they were passing through a particularly dense patch  of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped   harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is  used for   no said harry startled by the odd question weve  only used the horn and tail hair in potions   that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a  unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to  lose and everything to gain would commit such a  crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even  if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price  you have slain something pure and defenseless to  save yourself and you will have but a halflife a  cursed life from the moment the blood touches your  lips   harry stared at the back of firenzes head which was  dappled silver in the moonlight   but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if  youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt  it          it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay  alive long enough to drink something else    something that will bring you back to full strength  and power   something that will mean you can never  die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the  school at this very moment   the sorcerers stone of course   the elixir of life  but i dont understand who      can you think of nobody who has waited many years  to return to power who has clung to life awaiting  their chance   it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly  around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees  he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told  him on the night they had met some say he died  codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough  human left in him to die   do you mean harry croaked that was voz      harry harry are you all right   hermione was running toward them down the path  hagrid puffing along behind her   im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was  saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that  clearing back there   this is where i leave you firenze murmured as  hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are  safe now   harry slid off his back            good luck harry potter said firenze the planets  have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs  i hope this is one of those times   he turned and cantered back into the depths of the  forest leaving harry shivering behind him   ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room  waiting for them to return he shouted something  about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him  awake in a matter of seconds though he was wide  eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what  had happened in the forest   harry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in  front of the fire he was still shaking   snape wants the stone for voldemort  and  voldemorts waiting in the forest  and all this time  we thought snape just wanted to get rich    stop saying the name said ron in a terrified  whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them   harry wasnt listening   firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so   bane was furious  he was talking about interfering  with what the planets say is going to happen  they  must show that voldemorts coming back  bane  thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me  i  suppose thats written in the stars as well   will you stop saying the name ron hissed   so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the  stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will  be able to come and finish me off  well i suppose  bane  be happy          hermione looked very frightened but she had a word  of comfort   harry everyone says dumbledores the only one  youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore  around youknowwho wont touch you anyway  who says the centaurs are right it sounds like  fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says  thats a very imprecise branch of magic   the sky had turned light before they stopped talking  they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but  the nights surprises werent over   when harry pulled back his sheets he found his  invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them  there was a note pinned to it   just in case              through the trapdoor   in years to come harry would never quite remember  how he had managed to get through his exams when  he half expected voldemort to come bursting through  the door at any moment yet the days crept by and  there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and  well behind the locked door   it was sweltering hot especially in the large  classroom where they did their written papers they  had been given special new quills for the exams  which had been bewitched with an anticheating  spell   they had practical exams as well professor flitwick  called them one by one into his class to see if they  could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk  professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse  into a snuffbox   points were given for how pretty the  snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers  snape made them all nervous breathing down their  necks while they tried to remember how to make a  forgetfulness potion         harry did the best he could trying to ignore the  stabbing pains in his forehead which had been  bothering him ever since his trip into the forest  neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves  because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that  harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except  that it was now worse than ever because there was a  hooded figure dripping blood in it   maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry  had seen in the forest or because they didnt have  scars burning on their foreheads but ron and  hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as  harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them  but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they  were so busy with their studying they didnt have  much time to fret about what snape or anyone else  might be up to   their very last exam was history of magic one hour  of answering questions about batty old wizards whod  invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free  free for a whole wonderful week until their exam  results came out when the ghost of professor binns  told them to put down their quills and roll up their  parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the  rest   that was far easier than i thought it would be said  hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto  the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the   werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of  elfric the eager   hermione always liked to go through their exam  papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill  so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under  a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were            tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was  basking in the warm shallows     no more studying ron sighed happily stretching  out on the grass you could look more cheerful   harry weve got a week before we find out how badly  weve done theres no need to worry yet   harry was rubbing his forehead   i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily  my scar keeps hurting   its happened before but  never as often as this   go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested   im not ill said harry i think its a warning  it  means dangers coming    ron couldnt get worked up it was too hot   harry relax hermione s right the stones safe as  long as dumbledores around anyway weve never  had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy  he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to  try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch  for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down   harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking  feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do  something important when he tried to explain this  hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last  night and was halfway through my transfiguration  notes before i remembered wed done that one   harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have  anything to do with work though he watched an owl  flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a  note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one          who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray  dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to  get past fluffy    never    but     harry suddenly jumped to his feet   where re you going said ron sleepily   ive just thought of something said harry he had  turned white weve got to go and see hagrid now   why panted hermione hurrying to keep up   dont you think its a bit odd said harry  scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid  wants more than anything else is a dragon and a  stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in  his pocket how many people wander around with  dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they  found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it  before   what are you talking about said ron but harry  sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt  answer   hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house  his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was  shelling peas into a large bowl   hullo he said smiling finished yer exams got  time fer a drink   yes please said ron but harry cut him off   no were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you  something you know that night you won norbert  what did the stranger you were playing cards with  look like          dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his  cloak off     he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his  eyebrows   its not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in  the hogs head   thats one o the pubs down in the  village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i  never saw his face he kept his hood up   harry sank down next to the bowl of peas   what did you talk to him about hagrid did you  mention hogwarts at all   mighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried  to remember yeah  he asked what i did an i told  him i was gamekeeper here  he asked a bit about  the sorta creatures i look after  so i told him  an i  said what id always really wanted was a dragon   an then  i can remember too well cause he kept  buyin me drinks  lets see  yeah then he said he  had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i  wanted    but he had ter be sure i could handle it he  didn want it ter go ter any old home  so i told him  after fluffy a dragon would be easy    and did he   did he seem interested in fluffy   harry asked trying to keep his voice calm   well   yeah   how many threeheaded dogs dyeh  meet even around hogwarts so i told him fluffys a  piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus  play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter  sleep      hagrid suddenly looked horrified          i shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out forget i  said it hey   wherere yeh goin   harry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other  at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall  which seemed very cold and gloomy after the  grounds   weve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid  told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was  either snape or voldemort under that cloak   it  mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just  hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us  up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores  office   they looked around as if hoping to see a sign  pointing them in the right direction they had never  been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know  anyone who had been sent to see him   well just have to    harry began but a voice  suddenly rang across the hall   what are you three doing inside   it was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of  books   we want to see professor dumbledore said  hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought   see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall  repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to  want to do why   harry swallowed   now what            its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he  hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils  flared   professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said  coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry  of magic and flew off for london at once   hes gone said harry frantically now   professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter  he has many demands on his time      but this is important   something you have to say is more important than  the ministry of magic potter   look said harry throwing caution to the winds  professor   its about the sorcerers stone      whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it  wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out  of her arms but she didnt pick them up   how do you know    she spluttered   professor i think   i know   that sn   that  someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to  talk to professor dumbledore   she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion   professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she  said finally i dont know how you found out about  the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal  it its too well protected   but professor             potter i know what im talking about she said  shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen  books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy  the sunshine   but they didnt   its tonight said harry once he was sure professor  mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going  through the trapdoor tonight hes found out  everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore  out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of  magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns  up   but what can we      hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled round  snape was standing there   good afternoon he said smoothly   they stared at him   you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said  with an odd twisted smile   we were    harry began without any idea what he  was going to say   you want to be more careful said snape hanging  around like this people will think youre up to  something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose  any more points can it   harry flushed they turned to go outside but snape  called them back            be warned potter   any more nighttime wanderings  and i will personally make sure you are expelled   good day to you   he strode off in the direction of the staffroom   out on the stone steps harry turned to the others   right heres what weve got to do he whispered  urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape    wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he  leaves it hermione youd better do that   why me   its obvious said ron you can pretend to be  waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a  high voice  oh professor flitwick im so worried i  think i got question fourteen b wrong        oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go  and watch out for snape   and wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor  harry told ron come on   but that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had  they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest  of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up  again and this time she lost her temper   i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a  pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this  nonsense if i hear youve come anywhere near here  again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor   yes weasley from my own house   harry and ron went back to the common room harry  had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail          when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and  hermione came in   im sorry harry she wailed snape came out and  asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for  flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only  just got away i dont know where snape went   well thats it then isnt it harry said   the other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes  were glittering   im going out of here tonight and im going to try and  get to the stone first   youre mad said ron   you cant said hermione after what mcgonagall  and snape have said youll be expelled   so what harry shouted dont you understand  if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming  back havent you heard what it was like when he was  trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to  get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a  school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter  anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you  and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house  cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well  ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for  voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later  than i would have because im never going over to  the dark side im going through that trapdoor  tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me  voldemort killed my parents remember   he glared at them            youre right harry said hermione in a small voice     ill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just  lucky i got it back   but will it cover all three of us said ron   all   all three of us   oh come off it you dont think wed let you go  alone   of course not said hermione briskly how do you  think youd get to the stone without us id better go  and look through my books there might be  something useful    but if we get caught you two will be expelled too   not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick  told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve  percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out  after that   after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in  the common room nobody bothered them none of  the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any  more after all this was the first night he hadnt been  upset by it hermione was skimming through all her  notes hoping to come across one of the  enchantments they were about to try to break harry  and ron didnt talk much both of them were  thinking about what they were about to do   slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed   better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan  finally left stretching and yawning harry ran  upstairs to their dark dormitory he pulled out the          cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had  given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on  fluffy   he didnt feel much like singing   he ran back down to the common room   wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it  covers all three of us   if filch spots one of our feet  wandering along on its own      what are you doing said a voice from the corner of  the room neville appeared from behind an armchair  clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed  been making another bid for freedom   nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly  putting the cloak behind his back   neville stared at their guilty faces   youre going out again he said   no no no said hermione no were not why dont  you go to bed neville   harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door  they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape  might even now be playing fluffy to sleep   you cant go out said neville youll be caught  again gryffindor will be in even more trouble   you dont understand said harry this is  important   but neville was clearly steeling himself to do  something desperate            i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in  front of the portrait hole ill   ill fight you   neville ron exploded get away from that hole and  dont be an idiot      dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont  think you should be breaking any more rules and  you were the one who told me to stand up to people   yes but not to us said ron in exasperation   neville you dont know what youre doing   he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the  toad who leapt out of sight   go on then try and hit me said neville raising his  fists im ready   harry turned to hermione   do something he said desperately   hermione stepped forward   neville she said im really really sorry about this  she raised her wand   petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville   nevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang  together his whole body rigid he swayed where he  stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board   hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were  jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes  were moving looking at them in horror            whatve you done to him harry whispered     its the full bodybind said hermione miserably  oh neville im so sorry   we had to neville no time to explain said harry   youll understand later neville said ron as they  stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak   but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt  feel like a very good omen in their nervous state  every statues shadow looked like filch every distant  breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on  them   at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs  norris skulking near the top   oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in  harrys ear but harry shook his head as they  climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her  lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything   they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the  staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing  halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would  trip   whos there he said suddenly as they climbed  toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes  know youre there even if i cant see you are you  ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie   he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at  them   should call filch i should if somethings acreeping  around unseen          harry had a sudden idea     peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody  baron has his own reasons for being invisible   peeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught  himself in time and hovered about a foot off the  stairs   so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said  greasily my mistake my mistake   i didnt see you    of course i didnt youre invisible   forgive old  peevsie his little joke sir   i have business here peeves croaked harry stay  away from this place tonight   i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up  in the air again hope your business goes well   baron ill not bother you   and he scooted off   brilliant harry whispered ron   a few seconds later they were there outside the  thirdfloor corridor   and the door was already ajar   well there you are harry said quietly snapes  already got past fluffy   seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress  upon all three of them what was facing them  underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two   if you want to go back i wont blame you he said  you can take the cloak i wont need it now   dont be stupid said ron          were coming said hermione   harry pushed the door open   as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their  ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their  direction even though it couldnt see them   whats that at its feet hermione whispered   looks like a harp said ron snape must have left it  there   it must wake up the moment you stop playing said  harry well here goes    he put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt  really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes  began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the  dogs growls ceased   it tottered on its paws and fell  to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast  asleep   keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out  of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they  could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they  approached the giant heads   i think well be able to pull the door open said ron  peering over the dogs back want to go first  hermione   no i dont   all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully  over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the  trapdoor which swung up and open   what can you see hermione said anxiously          nothing   just black   theres no way of climbing  down well just have to drop   harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to  get his attention and pointed at himself   you want to go first are you sure said ron i  dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to  hermione so she can keep him asleep   harry handed the flute over in the few seconds  silence the dog growled and twitched but the  moment hermione began to play it fell back into its  deep sleep   harry climbed over it and looked down through the  trapdoor there was no sign of the bottom   he lowered himself through the hole until he was  hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at  ron and said if anything happens to me dont  follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to  dumbledore right   right said ron   see you in a minute i hope    and harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as  he fell down down down and     flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he  landed on something soft he sat up and felt around  his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he  was sitting on some sort of plant   its okay he called up to the light the size of a  postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a  soft landing you can jump          ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to  harry   whats this stuff were his first words   dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here  to break the fall come on hermione   the distant music stopped there was a loud bark  from the dog but hermione had already jumped she  landed on harrys other side   we must be miles under the school she said   lucky this plant things here really said ron   lucky shrieked hermione look at you both   she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she  had to struggle because the moment she had landed  the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils  around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs  had already been bound tightly in long creepers  without their noticing   hermione had managed to free herself before the  plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in  horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off  them but the more they strained against it the  tighter and faster the plant wound around them   stop moving hermione ordered them i know what  this is   its devils snare   oh im so glad we know what its called thats a  great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop  the plant from curling around his neck            shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said  hermione   well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped  wrestling with it as it curled around his chest   devils snare devils snare  what did professor  sprout say   it likes the dark and the damp      so light a fire harry choked   yes   of course   but theres no wood hermione  cried wringing her hands   have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a  witch or not   oh right said hermione and she whipped out her  wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of  the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at  the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it  loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light  and warmth wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself  from their bodies and they were able to pull free   lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione  said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat  off his face   yeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his  head in a crisis   theres no wood honestly   this way said harry pointing down a stone  passageway which was the only way forward   all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the  gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the  passageway sloped downward and harry was  reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the          heart he remembered the dragons said to be  guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a  dragon a fullygrown dragon   norbert had been bad  enough    can you hear something ron whispered   harry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to  be coming from up ahead   do you think its a ghost   i dont know  sounds like wings to me   theres light ahead   i can see something moving   they reached the end of the passageway and saw  before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling  arching high above them it was full of small jewel  bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the  room on the opposite side of the chamber was a  heavy wooden door   do you think theyll attack us if we cross the room  said ron   probably said harry they dont look very vicious  but i suppose if they all swooped down at once     well theres no other choice  ill run   he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms  and sprinted across the room he expected to feel  sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second  but nothing happened he reached the door  untouched he pulled the handle but it was locked   the other two followed him they tugged and heaved  at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when  hermione tried her alohomora charm          now what said ron     these birds  they cant be here just for decoration  said hermione   they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering    glittering   theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre  keys winged keys   look carefully so that must  mean  he looked around the chamber while the  other two squinted up at the flock of keys  yes    look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the  door   but there are hundreds of them   ron examined the lock on the door   were looking for a big oldfashioned one   probably  silver like the handle   they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the  air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they  grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted  and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to  catch one   not for nothing though was harry the youngest  seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting  things other people didnt after a minutes weaving  about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he  noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it  had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the  keyhole   that one he called to the others that big one    there   no there   with bright blue wings   the  feathers are all crumpled on one side          ron went speeding in the direction that harry was  pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off  his broom   weve got to close in on it harry called not taking  his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you  come at it from above   hermione stay below and  stop it from going down   and ill try and catch it  right now   ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key  dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped  toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a  nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone  with one hand ron and hermione s cheers echoed  around the high chamber   they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the  key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock  and turned   it worked the moment the lock had  clicked open the key took flight again looking very  battered now that it had been caught twice   ready harry asked the other two his hand on the  door handle they nodded he pulled the door open   the next chamber was so dark they couldnt see  anything at all but as they stepped into it light  suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing  sight   they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard  behind the black chessmen which were all taller than  they were and carved from what looked like black  stone facing them way across the chamber were  the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered  slightly   the towering white chessmen had no faces   now what do we do harry whispered          its obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our  way across the room     behind the white pieces they could see another door   how said hermione nervously   i think said ron were going to have to be  chessmen   he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out  to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang  to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight  turned his helmeted head to look down at ron   do we   er   have to join you to get across   the black knight nodded ron turned to the other  two   this needs thinking about  he said i suppose  weve got to take the place of three of the black pieces     harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron  think finally he said now dont be offended or  anything but neither of you are that good at chess       were not offended said harry quickly just tell us  what to do   well harry you take the place of that bishop and  hermione you go there instead of that castle   what about you   im going to be a knight said ron          the chessmen seemed to have been listening because  at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned  their backs on the white pieces and walked off the  board leaving three empty squares that harry ron  and hermione took   white always plays first in chess said ron peering  across the board yes  look    a white pawn had moved forward two squares   ron started to direct the black pieces they moved  silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were  trembling what if they lost   harry   move diagonally four squares to the right   their first real shock came when their other knight  was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor  and dragged him off the board where he lay quite  still facedown   had to let that happen said ron looking shaken  leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go  on   every time one of their men was lost the white pieces  showed no mercy soon there was a huddle of limp  black players slumped along the wall twice ron only  just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in  danger he himself darted around the board taking  almost as many white pieces as they had lost black  ones   were nearly there he muttered suddenly let me  think   let me think    the white queen turned her blank face toward him            yes  said ron softly its the only way  ive got  to be taken     no harry and hermione shouted   thats chess snapped ron youve got to make  some sacrifices i make my move and shell take me    that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry   but      do you want to stop snape or not   ron      look if you dont hurry up hell already have the  stone   there was no alternative   ready ron called his face pale but determined  here i go   now dont hang around once youve  won   he stepped forward and the white queen pounced  she struck ron hard across the head with her stone  arm and he crashed to the floor   hermione  screamed but stayed on her square   the white  queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed  been knocked out   shaking harry moved three spaces to the left   the white king took off his crown and threw it at  harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and  bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last  desperate look back at ron harry and hermione  charged through the door and up the next  passageway          what if hes        hell be all right said harry trying to convince  himself what do you reckons next   weve had sprouts that was the devils snare  flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall  transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that  leaves quirrells spell and snapes    they had reached another door   all right harry whispered   go on   harry pushed it open   a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of  them pull their robes up over their noses eyes  watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a  troll even larger than the one they had tackled out  cold with a bloody lump on its head   im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry  whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its  massive legs come on i cant breathe   he pulled open the next door both of them hardly  daring to look at what came next   but there was  nothing very frightening in here just a table with  seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a  line   snapes said harry what do we have to do   they stepped over the threshold and immediately a  fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt  ordinary fire either it was purple at the same          instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading  onward they were trapped   look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to  the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it   danger lies before you while safety lies behind   two of us will help you whichever you would find   one among us seven will let you move ahead   another will transport the drinker back instead   two among our number hold only nettle wine   three of us are killers waiting hidden in line   choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore   to help you in your choice we give you these clues  four   first however slyly the poison tries to hide   you will always find some on nettle wines left side   second different are those who stand at either end   but if you would move onward neither is your friend   third as you see clearly all are different size   neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides   fourth the second left and the second on the right   are twins once you taste them though different at first  sight          hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw  that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like  doing   brilliant said hermione this isnt magic   its  logic   a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizards havent  got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever   but so will we wont we   of course not said hermione everything we need  is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison  two are wine one will get us safely through the black  fire and one will get us back through the purple   but how do we know which to drink   give me a minute   hermione read the paper several times then she  walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to  herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her  hands   got it she said the smallest bottle will get us  through the black fire   toward the stone   harry looked at the tiny bottle   theres only enough there for one of us he said  thats hardly one swallow   they looked at each other   which one will get you back through the purple  flames   hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end  of the line          you drink that said harry no listen get back and  get ron grab brooms from the flyingkey room  theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy    go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to  dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold  snape off for a while but im no match for him  really   but harry   what if youknow whos with him   well   i was lucky once wasnt i said harry  pointing at his scar i might get lucky again   hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at  harry and threw her arms around him   hermionel   harry   youre a great wizard you know   im not as good as you said harry very  embarrassed as she let go of him   me said hermione books and cleverness there  are more important things   friendship and bravery  and   oh harry   be carefull   you drink first said harry you are sure which is  which arent you   positive said hermione she took a long drink from  the round bottle at the end and shuddered   its not poison said harry anxiously   no   but its like ice   quick go before it wears off            good luck   take care        go   hermione turned and walked straight through the  purple fire   harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest  bottle he turned to face the black flames   here i come he said and he drained the little bottle  in one gulp   it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he  put the bottle down and walked forward he braced  himself saw the black flames licking his body but  couldnt feel them   for a moment he could see  nothing but dark fire   then he was on the other  side in the last chamber   there was already someone there   but it wasnt  snape it wasnt even voldemort              the man with two faces   it was quirrell   you gasped harry   quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all   me he said calmly i wondered whether id be  meeting you here potter   but i thought   snape      severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual  quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes  severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to  have him swooping around like an overgrown bat   next to him who would suspect pppoor st  stuttering pprofessor quirrell   harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it  couldnt   but snape tried to kill me         no no no  tried to kill you your friend miss  granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed  to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she  broke my eye contact with you another few seconds  and id have got you off that broom id have managed  it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a  countercurse trying to save you   snape was trying to save me   of course said quirrell coolly why do you think  he wanted to referee your next match he was trying  to make sure i didnt do it again funny really  he  neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with  dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought  snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he  did make himself unpopular    and what a waste of  time when after all that im going to kill you tonight   quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin  air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry   youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the  school on halloween like that for all i knew youd  seen me coming to look at what was guarding the  stone    you let the troll in   certainly i have a special gift with trolls   you must  have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back  there unfortunately while everyone else was  running around looking for it snape who already  suspected me went straight to the third floor to head  me off   and not only did my troll fail to beat you to  death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to  bite snape s leg off properly            now wait quietly potter i need to examine this  interesting mirror   it was only then that harry realized what was  standing behind quirrell it was the mirror of erised   this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell  murmured tapping his way around the frame trust  dumbledore to come up with something like this     but hes in london  ill be far away by the time he  gets back    all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell  talking and stop him from concentrating on the  mirror   i saw you and snape in the forest    he blurted out   yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to  look at the back he was on to me by that time  trying to find out how far id got he suspected me all  along tried to frighten me   as though he could  when i had lord voldemort on my side    quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and  stared hungrily into it   i see the stone  im presenting it to my master   but where is it   harry struggled against the ropes binding him but  they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving  his whole attention to the mirror   but snape always seemed to hate me so much   oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes  he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you            know they loathed each other but he never wanted  you dead   but i heard you a few days ago sobbing   i thought  snape was threatening you   for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across  quirrells face   sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my  masters instructions   he is a great wizard and i am  weak      you mean he was there in the classroom with you  harry gasped   he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i  met him when i traveled around the world a foolish  young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about  good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong  i was there is no good and evil there is only power  and those too weak to seek it  since then i have  served him faithfully although i have let him down  many times he has had to be very hard on me  quirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive  mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from  gringotts he was most displeased he punished me     decided he would have to keep a closer watch on  me    quirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering  his trip to diagon alley   how could he have been so  stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken  hands with him in the leaky cauldron   quirrell cursed under his breath   i dont understand  is the stone inside the mirror  should i break it          harrys mind was racing     what i want more than anything else in the world at  the moment he thought is to find the stone before  quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see  my self finding it   which means ill see where its  hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing  what im up to   he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass  without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his  ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell  ignored him he was still talking to himself   what does this mirror do how does it work help  me master   and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice  seemed to come from quirrell himself   use the boy  use the boy    quirrell rounded on harry   yes   potter   come here   he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding  harry fell off harry got slowly to his feet   come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror  and tell me what you see   harry walked toward him   i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie  about what i see thats all   quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in  the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells          turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the  mirror and opened them again   he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first  but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it  put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood  red stone it winked and put the stone back in its  pocket   and as it did so harry felt something heavy  drop into his real pocket somehow   incredibly    hed gotten the stone   well said quirrell impatiently what do you see  harry screwed up his courage   i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he  invented i   ive won the house cup for gryffindor   quirrell cursed again   get out of the way he said as harry moved aside  he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he  make a break for it   but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice  spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips   he lies  he lies    potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me  the truth what did you just see   the high voice spoke again   let me speak to him  facetoface    master you are not strong enough   i have strength enough  for this           harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the  spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he  watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap  his turban what was going on the turban fell away  quirrells head looked strangely small without it   then he turned slowly on the spot   harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a  sound where there should have been a back to  quirrells head there was a face the most terrible  face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with  glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake   harry potter  it whispered   harry tried to take a step backward but his legs  wouldnt move   see what i have become the face said mere  shadow and vapor  i have form only when i can  share anothers body    but there have always been  those willing to let me into their hearts and minds   unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks     you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the  forest  and once i have the elixir of life i will be  able to create a body of my own  now  why dont  you give me that stone in your pocket   so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into  harrys legs he stumbled backward   dont be a fool snarled the face better save your  own life and join me  or youll meet the same end as  your parents  they died begging me for mercy    liar harry shouted suddenly            quirrell was walking backward at him so that  voldemort could still see him the evil face was now  smiling   how touching  it hissed i always value bravery    yes boy your parents were brave  i killed your  father first and he put up a courageous fight    but  your mother neednt have died  she was trying to  protect you  now give me the stone unless you  want her to have died in vain   never   harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort  screamed seize him and the next second harry  felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a  needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his  head felt as though it was about to split in two he  yelled struggling with all his might and to his  surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head  lessened   he looked around wildly to see where  quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain  looking at his fingers   they were blistering before his  eyes   seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again  and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet  landing on top of him both hands around harrys  neck   harrys scar was almost blinding him with  pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony   master i cannot hold him   my hands   my  hands   and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground  with his knees let go of his neck and stared  bewildered at his own palms   harry could see they  looked burned raw red and shiny            then kill him fool and be done screeched  voldemort   quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse  but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed  quirrells face     aaaargh   quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and  then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare  skin not without suffering terrible pain   his only  chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in  enough pain to stop him from doing a curse   harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm  and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed  and tried to throw harry off   the pain in harrys  head was building   he couldnt see   he could only  hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells  of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in  harrys own head crying harry harry   he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew  all was lost and fell into blackness down  down   down    something gold was glinting just above him the  snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too  heavy   he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of  glasses how strange   he blinked again the smiling face of albus  dumbledore swam into view above him   good afternoon harry said dumbledore            harry stared at him then he remembered sir the  stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick       calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the  times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the  stone   then who does sir i      harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me  thrown out   harry swallowed and looked around him he realized  he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed  with white linen sheets and next to him was a table  piled high with what looked like half the candy shop   tokens from your friends and admirers said  dumbledore beaming what happened down in the  dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a  complete secret so naturally the whole school  knows i believe your friends misters fred and george  weasley were responsible for trying to send you a  toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse  you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be  very hygienic and confiscated it   how long have i been in here   three days mr ronald weasley and miss granger  will be most relieved you have come round they have  been extremely worried   but sir the stone      i see you are not to be distracted very well the  stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it            from you i arrived in time to prevent that although  you were doing very well on your own i must say   you got there you got hermiones owl   we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i  reached london than it became clear to me that the  place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived  just in time to pull quirrell off you      it was you   i feared i might be too late   you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the  stone much longer      not the stone boy you   the effort involved nearly  killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid  it had as for the stone it has been destroyed   destroyed said harry blankly but your friend    nicolas flamel      oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore  sounding quite delighted you did do the thing  properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a  little chat and agreed its all for the best   but that means he and his wife will die wont they   they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in  order and then yes they will die   dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on  harrys face   to one as young as you im sure it seems incredible  but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to          bed after a very very long day after all to the well  organized mind death is but the next great  adventure you know the stone was really not such a  wonderful thing as much money and life as you  could want the two things most human beings would  choose above all   the trouble is humans do have a  knack of choosing precisely those things that are  worst for them   harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed  a little and smiled at the ceiling   sir said harry ive been thinking  sir   even if  the stones gone vol i mean youknowwho      call him voldemort harry always use the proper  name for things fear of a name increases fear of the  thing itself   yes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of  coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has  he   no harry he has not he is still out there  somewhere perhaps looking for another body to  share  not being truly alive he cannot be killed he  left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his  followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while  you may only have delayed his return to power it will  merely take someone else who is prepared to fight  what seems a losing battle next time   and if he is  delayed again and again why he may never return  to power   harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made  his head hurt then he said sir there are some  other things id like to know if you can tell me   things i want to know the truth about             the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and  terrible thing and should therefore be treated with  great caution however i shall answer your questions  unless i have a very good reason not to in which case  i beg you  forgive me i shall not of course lie   well  voldemort said that he only killed my mother  because she tried to stop him from killing me but  why would he want to kill me in the first place   dumbledore sighed very deeply this time   alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you   not today not now you will know one day  put it  from your mind for now harry when you are older     i know you hate to hear this    when you are ready  you will know   and harry knew it would be no good to argue   but why couldnt quirrell touch me   your mother died to save you if there is one thing  voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt  realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you  leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign  to  have been loved so deeply even though the person  who loved us is gone will give us some protection  forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred  greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort  could not touch you for this reason it was agony to  touch a person marked by something so good   dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out  on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his  eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again  harry said and the invisibility cloak   do you know  who sent it to me            ah   your father happened to leave it in my  possession and i thought you might like it  dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things  your  father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens  to steal food when he was here   and theres something else    fire away   quirrell said snape      professor snape harry   yes him   quirrell said he hates me because he  hated my father is that true   well they did rather detest each other not unlike  yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did  something snape could never forgive   what   he saved his life   what   yes  said dumbledore dreamily funny the way  peoples minds work isnt it professor snape  couldnt bear being in your fathers debt  i do  believe he worked so hard to protect you this year  because he felt that would make him and your father  even then he could go back to hating your fathers  memory in peace    harry tried to understand this but it made his head  pound so he stopped   and sir theres one more thing           just the one     how did i get the stone out of the mirror   ah now im glad you asked me that it was one of  my more brilliant ideas and between you and me  thats saying something you see only one who  wanted to find the stone   find it but not use it    would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see  themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my  brain surprises even me sometimes  now enough  questions i suggest you make a start on these  sweets ah bertie botts every flavor beans i was  unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a  vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive  rather lost my liking for them   but i think ill be safe  with a nice toffee dont you   he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his  mouth then he choked and said alas ear wax   madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but  very strict   just five minutes harry pleaded   absolutely not   you let professor dumbledore in    well of course that was the headmaster quite  different you need rest   i am resting look lying down and everything oh go  on madam pomfrey    oh very well she said but five minutes only   and she let ron and hermione in          harryl     hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him  again but harry was glad she held herself in as his  head was still very sore   oh harry we were sure you were going to    dumbledore was so worried      the whole schools talking about it said ron what  really happened   it was one of those rare occasions when the true story  is even more strange and exciting than the wild  rumors harry told them everything quirrell the  mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione  were a very good audience they gasped in all the  right places and when harry told them what was  under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud   so the stones gone said ron finally flamels just  going to die   thats what i said but dumbledore thinks that    what was it   to the wellorganized mind death is  but the next great adventure    i always said he was off his rocker said ron  looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was   so what happened to you two said harry   well i got back all right said hermione i brought  ron round   that took a while   and we were  dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when  we met him in the entrance hall   he already knew    he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and  hurtled off to the third floor          dyou think he meant you to do it said ron  sending you your fathers cloak and everything   well hermione exploded if he did   i mean to say    thats terrible   you could have been killed   no it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny  man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give  me a chance i think he knows more or less  everything that goes on here you know i reckon he  had a pretty good idea we were going to try and  instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to  help i dont think it was an accident he let me find  out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought  i had the right to face voldemort if i could    yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said  ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the end  ofyear feast tomorrow the points are all in and  slytherin won of course   you missed the last  quidditch match we were steamrollered by  ravenclaw without you   but the foodll be good   at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over   youve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she  said firmly         after a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to  normal   i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as  she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant  i            professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to  go she said sniffily as though in her opinion  professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts  could be and you have another visitor   oh good said harry who is it   hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual  when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be  allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at  him and burst into tears   its   all   my   ruddy   fault he sobbed his  face in his hands i told the evil git how ter get past  fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt  know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a  dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked  out an made ter live as a muggle   hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking  with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into  his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow  this is voldemort were talking about hed have found  out even if you hadnt told him   yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the  name   voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so  shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im  calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we  saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a  chocolate frog ive got loads    hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and  said that reminds me ive got yeh a present   its not a stoat sandwich is it said harry  anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle          nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter  fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead    anyway got y eh this    it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book  harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard  photographs smiling and waving at him from every  page were his mother and father   sent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends  askin fer photos  knew yeh didn have any  dyeh  like it   harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood   harry made his way down to the endofyear feast  alone that night he had been held up by madam  pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one  last checkup so the great hall was already full it  was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and  silver to celebrate slytherin s winning the house cup  for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing  the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the  high table   when harry walked in there was a sudden hush and  then everybody started talking loudly at once he  slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the  gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that  people were standing up to look at him   fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the  babble died away   another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully   and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing  waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious  feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads  are all a little fuller than they were    you have the         whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty  before next year starts    now as i understand it the house cup here needs  awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place  gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in  third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo  ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and  slytherin four hundred and seventy two   a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the  slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging  his goblet on the table it was a sickening sight   yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore  however recent events must be taken into account   the room went very still the slytherins smiles faded  a little   ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute  points to dish out let me see yes    first   to mr ronald weasley    ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish  with a bad sunburn    for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has  seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty  points   gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling  the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be  heard telling the other prefects my brother you  know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls  giant chess set   at last there was silence again          second   to miss hermione granger    for the use of  cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house  fifty points   hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly  suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up  and down the table were beside themselves   they  were a hundred points up   third   to mr harry potter  said dumbledore   the room went deadly quiet  for pure nerve and  outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty  points   the din was deafening those who could add up while  yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now  had four hundred and seventytwo points   exactly  the same as slytherin they had tied for the house  cup   if only dumbledore had given harry just one  more point   dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell  silent   there are all kinds of courage said dumbledore  smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up  to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our  friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville  longbottom   someone standing outside the great hall might well  have thought some sort of explosion had taken place  so loud was the noise that erupted from the  gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up  to yell and cheer as neville white with shock  disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he  had never won so much as a point for gryffindor  before harry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs  and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more         stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind  curse put on him   which means dumbledore called over the storm of  applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were  celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little  change of decoration   he clapped his hands in an instant the green  hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold  the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering  gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking  professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced  smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once  that snape s feelings toward him hadnt changed one  jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life  would be back to normal next year or as normal as it  ever was at hogwarts   it was the best evening of harrys life better than  winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out  mountain trolls  he would never ever forget tonight   harry had almost forgotten that the exam results  were still to come but come they did to their great  surprise both he and ron passed with good marks  hermione of course had the best grades of the first  years even neville scraped through his good  herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions  one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as  stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he  had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you  couldnt have everything in life   and suddenly their wardrobes were empty their  trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking  in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all  students warning them not to use magic over the  holidays i always hope theyll forget to give us         these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to  take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across  the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express  talking and laughing as the countryside became  greener and tidier eating bertie botts every flavor  beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off  their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats  pulling into platform nine and threequarters at  kings cross station   it took quite a while for them all to get off the  platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket  barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and  threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting  out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles   you must come and stay this summer said ron  both of you   ill send you an owl   thanks said harry ill need something to look  forward to   people jostled them as they moved forward toward the  gateway back to the muggle world some of them  called   bye harry   see you potter   still famous said ron grinning at him   not where im going i promise you said harry   he ron and hermione passed through the gateway  together   there he is mom there he is look            it was ginny weasley rons younger sister but she  wasnt pointing at ron   harry potter she squealed look mom i can see  be quiet ginny and its rude to point   mrs weasley smiled down at them   busy year she said   very said harry thanks for the fudge and the  sweater mrs weasley   oh it was nothing dear   ready are you   it was uncle vernon still purplefaced still  mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry  carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary  people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley  looking terrified at the very sight of harry   you must be harrys family said mrs weasley   in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry  up boy we havent got all day he walked away   harry hung back for a last word with ron and  hermione   see you over the summer then   hope you have   er   a good holiday said  hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon  shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant            oh i will said harry and they were surprised at  the grin that was spreading over his face  they dont  know were not allowed to use magic at home im  going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer            '"

arm supporting the sight gave the creep the restricted section wa right the back the library stepping carefully the rope separated these book the rest the library held his lamp read the title they didnt tell much their peeling faded gold letter spelled word language harry couldnt understand some had title all one book had a dark stain looked horribly like blood the hair the back harrys neck prickled maybe wa imagining maybe thought a faint whispering wa coming the book though they knew someone wa shouldnt had start somewhere setting the lamp carefully the floor looked along the bottom shelf interestinglooking book a large black silver volume caught his eye pulled difficulty wa very heavy balancing his knee let fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book wa screaming harry snapped shut the shriek went one high unbroken earsplitting note stumbled backward knocked his lamp went once panicking heard footstep coming the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back the shelf ran passed filch the doorway filchs pale wild eye looked straight harry slipped filchs outstretched arm streaked the corridor the book shriek still ringing his ear came a sudden halt front a tall suit armor had been busy getting away the library hadnt paid attention wa going perhaps wa dark didnt recognize wa all wa a suit armor near the kitchen knew must five floor

a narrow corridor they came much nearer theyd knock right the cloak didnt stop being solid backed away quietly could a door stood ajar his left wa his hope squeezed holding his breath trying move his relief managed get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past harry leaned the wall breathing deeply listening their footstep dying away had been close very close wa a few second noticed anything the room had hidden looked like unused classroom the dark shape desk chair piled the wall wa upturned wastepaper basket propped the wall facing wa something didnt look

hagrid arm hagrid look red spark the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay the path ill come back yeh they heard him crashing away the undergrowth stood looking each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything the rustling leaf around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy if somethings got neville it our fault he here in the first place the minute dragged their ear seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed be picking every sigh the wind every cracking twig what wa going were the others last a great crunching noise

anythin now the racket you two were makin right were changin group neville you stay with an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper harry hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set into the heart the forest with malfoy fang they walked nearly half an hour deeper deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible follow because the tree were so thick harry thought the blood seemed be getting thicker there were splash the root a tree though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close harry could see a clearing ahead the tangled branch of an ancient oak look he murmured holding his arm stop malfoy something bright white wa gleaming the ground they inched closer it wa the unicorn all right it wa dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful sad it long slender leg were stuck odd angle where it had fallen it mane wa spread pearlywhite the dark leaf harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered then of the shadow a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered it head over the wound in the animal side began drink it blood aaaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let a terrible scream bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised it head looked right harry unicorn blood wa dribbling it front it got it foot came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it wa though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hoof behind him galloping something jumped clean over harry charging the figure the pain in harrys head wa so bad he fell his knee it took a minute two pas when he looked the figure had gone a centaur wa standing over him not ronan bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry his foot yes thank you what wa that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eye like pale sapphire he looked carefully harry his eye lingering on the scar that stood livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially you can you ride it be quicker this way my name is firenze he added he lowered himself on his front leg so that harry could clamber onto his back there wa suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan bane came bursting the tree their flank heaving sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaf this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not set the heaven have we not read what is come in the movement of the planet ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he wa acting the best he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back leg in anger the best what is that do with u centaur are concerned with what been foretold it is not our business run around like donkey stray human in our forest firenze suddenly reared on his hind leg in anger so that harry had grab his shoulder stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it wa killed have the planet not let you in on that secret i set what is lurking in this forest bane yes with human alongside if i must firenze whisked around with harry clutching on best he could they plunged into the tree leaving ronan bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what wa going on why bane so angry he asked what wa that thing you saved from anyway firenze slowed a walk warned harry keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branch did not answer harrys question they made their way the tree in silence so long that harry thought firenze didnt want talk him anymore they were passing a particularly dense patch of tree however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used no said harry startled the odd question weve only used the horn tail hair in potion that is because it is a monstrous thing slay a unicorn said firenze only one nothing lose everything gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn keep you alive even if you are an inch from death at a terrible price you have slain something pure defenseless save you have a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touch your lip harry stared at the back of firenze head wa dappled silver in the moonlight whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going be cursed forever death better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is stay alive long enough drink something else something that bring you back full strength power something that mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer stone of course the elixir of life i dont understand can you think of nobody waited many year return power clung life awaiting their chance it wa though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the tree he seemed hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him die do you mean harry croaked that wa voz harry harry are you all right hermione wa running toward them the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he wa saying the unicorn dead hagrid it in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured hagrid hurried examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planet have been read wrongly before now even by centaur i hope this is one of those time he turned cantered back into the depth of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting them return he shouted something about quidditch foul when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of second though he wa wide eyed harry began tell him hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit he paced in front of the fire he wa still shaking snape want the stone voldemort voldemorts waiting in the forest all this time we thought snape just wanted get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved he shouldnt have done so bane wa furious he wa talking about interfering with what the planet say is going happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane think firenze should have let voldemort kill i suppose thats written in the star well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got wait now is snape steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able come finish well i suppose bane be happy hermione looked very frightened she had a word of comfort harry everyone say dumbledores the only one youknowwho wa ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway say the centaur are right it sound like fortunetelling professor mcgonagall say thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went bed exhausted their throat sore the night surprise werent over when harry pulled back his sheet he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there wa a note pinned it just in case the trapdoor in year come harry would never quite remember how he had managed get his exam when he half expected voldemort come bursting the door at any moment yet the day crept by there could be no doubt that fluffy wa still alive well behind the locked door it wa sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written paper they had been given special new quill the exam had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exam well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox point were given for how pretty the snuffbox wa taken away if it had whisker snape made them all nervous breathing their neck while they tried remember how make a forgetfulness potion harry did the best he could trying ignore the stabbing pain in his forehead had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerve because harry couldnt sleep the truth wa that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it wa now worse than ever because there wa a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it wa because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest because they didnt have scar burning on their forehead ron hermione didnt seem worried about the stone harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them he didnt keep visiting them in dream they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time fret about what snape anyone else might be their very last exam wa history of magic one hour of answering question about batty old wizard whod invented selfstirring cauldron theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam result came when the ghost of professor binns told them put their quill roll their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the rest that wa far easier than i thought it would be said hermione they joined the crowd flocking onto the sunny ground i neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked go their exam paper afterward ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered the lake flopped a tree the weasley twin lee jordan were tickling the tentacle of a giant squid wa basking in the warm shallow no more studying ron sighed happily stretching on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find how badly weve done there no need worry yet harry wa rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this mean he burst angrily my scar keep hurting it happened before never often this go madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry i think it a warning it mean danger coming ron couldnt get worked it wa too hot harry relax hermione right the stone safe long dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped once he not going try it in a hurry neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid let dumbledore harry nodded he couldnt shake a lurking feeling that there wa something hed forgotten do something important when he tried explain this hermione said thats just the exam i woke last night wa halfway through my transfiguration note before i remembered wed done that one harry wa quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in it mouth hagrid wa the only one ever sent him letter hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how get past fluffy never harry suddenly jumped his foot where re you going said ron sleepily ive just thought of something said harry he had turned white weve got go see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying keep dont you think it a bit odd said harry scrambling the grassy slope that what hagrid want more than anything else is a dragon a stranger turn just happens have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon egg if it against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before what are you talking about said ron harry sprinting across the ground toward the forest didnt answer hagrid wa sitting in an armchair outside his house his trouser sleeve were rolled he wa

inside it wa professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of book we want see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated a though this wa a very fishy thing want do why harry swallowed now what it sort of secret he said he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostril flared professor dumbledore left ten minute ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic flew off for london at once he gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he ha many demand on his time this is important something you have say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution the wind professor it about the sorcerer stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the book she wa carrying tumbled out of her arm she didnt pick them how do you know she spluttered professor i think i know that sn that someone going try steal the stone ive got talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone rest assured no one can possibly steal it it too well protected professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent gathered the fallen book i suggest you all go back outside enjoy the sunshine they didnt it tonight said harry once he wa sure professor mcgonagall wa out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight he found out everything he need now he got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turn what can we hermione gasped harry ron wheeled round snape wa standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were harry began without any idea what he wa going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre to something gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more point can it harry flushed they turned to go outside snape called them back be warned potter any more nighttime wandering i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone step harry turned to the others right here what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of u ha got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom follow him if he leaf it hermione youd better do that why it obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut said hermione she agreed to go watch out for snape wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told ron come on that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned again this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantment she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear youve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty point from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open hermione came in im sorry harry she wailed snape came out asked what i wa doing so i said i wa waiting for flitwick snape went to get him ive only just got away i dont know where snape went well thats it then isnt it harry said the other two stared at him he wa pale his eye were glittering im going out of here tonight im going to try get to the stone first youre mad said ron you cant said hermione what mcgonagall snape have said youll be expelled so what harry shouted dont you understand if snape get hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it wa like when he wa trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark art losing point doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you your family alone if gryffindor win the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys wait for voldemort to find there it only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight nothing you two say is going

three of u said ron all all three of u oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without u id better go look through my book there might be something useful if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told in secret that i got a hundred twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing out that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this wa the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione wa skimming through all her note hoping to come across one of the enchantment they were about to try to break harry ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied a people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered a lee jordan finally left stretching yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he pulled out the cloak then his eye fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singing he ran back to the common room wed better put the cloak on here make sure it cover all three of u if filch spot one of our foot wandering along on it own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad looked a though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty face youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important neville wa clearly steeling himself to do something desperate i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole dont be an idiot dont you call an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rule you were the one told to stand to people yes not to u said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took a step forward neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try hit said neville raising his fist im ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arm snapped to his side his leg sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood then fell flat on his face stiff a a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaw were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eye were moving looking at them in horror whatve you done to him harry whispered it the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron a they stepped over him pulled on the invisibility cloak leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statue shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeve swooping on them at the foot of the first set of stair they spotted mr norris skulking near the top oh let kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear harry shook his head a they climbed carefully around her mr norris turned her lamplike eye on them didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase to the third floor peeve wa bobbing halfway loosening the carpet so that people would trip who there he said suddenly a they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eye know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose in the air floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea peeve he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron ha his own reason for being invisible peeve almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time hovered about a foot off the stair so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeve croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeve rising in the air again hope your business go well baron ill not bother you he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron a few second later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor the door wa already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what wa facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open a the door creaked low rumbling growl met their ear all three of the dog nose sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at it foot hermione whispered look like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake the moment you stop playing said harry well here go he put hagrids flute to his lip blew it wasnt really a tune from the first note the beast eye began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dog growl ceased it tottered on it paw fell to it knee then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry a they slipped out of the cloak crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dog hot smelly breath a they approached the giant head i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog back want to go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth stepped carefully over the dog leg he bent pulled the ring of the trapdoor swung up open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing just black there no way of climbing well just have to drop harry who wa still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing go give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few second silence the dog growled twitched the moment hermione began to play it fell back into it deep sleep harry climbed over it looked through the trapdoor there wa no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he wa hanging on by his fingertip then he looked up at ron said if anything happens to dont follow go straight to the owlery send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope harry let go cold damp air rushed past him a he fell down flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up felt around his eye not used to the gloom it felt a though he wa sitting on some sort of plant it okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp wa the open trapdoor it a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry whats this stuff were his first word dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose it here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there wa a loud bark from the dog hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be mile under the school she said lucky this plant thing here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendril around her ankle a for harry ron their leg had already been bound tightly in long creeper without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror a the two boy fought to pull the plant off them the more they strained against it the tighter faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is it devil snare oh im so glad we know what it called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it a it curled around his chest devil snare devil snare what did professor sprout say it like the dark the damp so light a fire harry choked yes of course there no wood hermione cried wringing her hand have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something sent a jet of the same bluebell flame she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of second the two boy felt it loosening it grip a it cringed away from the light warmth wriggling flailing it unraveled from their body they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry a he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis there no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway wa the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footstep wa the gentle drip of water trickling down the wall the passageway sloped downward harry wa reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragon said to be guarding vault in the wizard bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think it a ghost i dont know sound like wing to there light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber it ceiling arching high above them it wa full of small jewel bright bird fluttering tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber wa a heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack u if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious i suppose if they all swooped down at once well there no other choice ill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arm sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beak claw tearing at him any second nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle it wa locked the other two followed him they tugged heaved at the door it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these bird they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the bird soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not bird harry said suddenly theyre key winged key look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of key yes look broomstick weve got to catch the key to the door there are hundred of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of key they grabbed snatched but the bewitched key darted dived so quickly it wa almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though wa harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting thing other people didnt after a minute weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feather he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing a if it had already been caught stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wing the feather are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry wa pointing crashed into the ceiling nearly fell off his broom weve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eye off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below stop it from going down ill try catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron hermione cheer echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber wa so dark they couldnt see anything at all but a they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessman were all taller than they were carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white piece harry ron hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessman had no face now what do we do harry whispered it obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the room behind the white piece they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessman he walked up to a black knight put his hand out to touch the knight horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this need thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black piece harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell u what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you im going to be a knight said ron the chessman seemed to have been listening because at these word a knight a bishop and a castle turned their back on the white piece and walked off the board leaving three empty square that harry ron and hermione took white always play first in chess said ron peering across the board yes look a white pawn had moved forward two square ron started to direct the black piece they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knee were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four square to the right their first real shock came when their other knight wa taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaf you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men wa lost the white piece showed no mercy soon there wa a huddle of limp black player slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost a many white piece a they had lost black one were nearly there he muttered suddenly let think let think the white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly it the only way ive got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifice i make my move and shell take that leaf you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone there wa no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked a if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three space to the left the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys foot they had won the chessman parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway what if he hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprout that wa the devil snare flitwick mustve put charm on the key mcgonagall transfigured the chessman to make them alive that leaf quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostril making both of them pull their robe up over their nose eye watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on it head im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered a they stepped carefully over one of it massive leg come on i cant breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there wa nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottle standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it wa purple at the same instant black flame shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottle harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lie before you while safety lie behind two of u will help you whichever you would find one among u seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number

different size neither dwarf giant hold death in their inside fourth the second left and the second on the right are twin once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she wa smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic it logic a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizard havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever but so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottle three are poison two are wine one will get u safely through the black fire and one will get u back through the purple but how do we know to drink give a minute hermione read the paper several time then she walked up and down the line of bottle muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hand got it she said the smallest bottle will get u through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle there only enough there for one of u he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other one will get you back through the purple flame hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab broom from the flyingkey room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him really but harry what if youknow who with him well i wa lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arm around him hermionel harry youre a great wizard you know im not a good a you said harry very embarrassed a she let go of him said hermione book and cleverness there are more important thing friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefull you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered it not poison said harry anxiously no but it like ice quick go before it wear off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flame here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it wa indeed a though ice wa flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flame licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he wa on the other side in the last chamber there wa already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort the man with two face it wa quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus doe seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor st stuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried to kill no no no tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked over a she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few second and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape wa trying to save of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he wa trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teacher thought snape wa trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his finger rope sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen coming to look at what wa guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with troll you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else wa running around looking for it snape who already suspected went straight to the third floor to head off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snape leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it wa only then that harry realized what wa standing behind quirrell it wa the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but he in london ill be far away by the time he get back all harry could think of doing wa to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he wa on to by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected all along tried to frighten a though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the rope binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate so much oh he doe said quirrell casually heaven yes he wa at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few day ago sobbing i thought snape wa threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master instruction he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he wa there in the classroom with you harry gasped he is with wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i wa then full of ridiculous idea about good and evil lord voldemort showed how wrong i wa there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many time he ha had to be very hard on quirrell shivered suddenly he doe not forgive mistake easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he wa most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry wa remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hand with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break it harrys mind wa racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell doe so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which mean ill see where it hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the rope around his ankle were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he wa still talking to himself what doe this mirror do how doe it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hand once and the rope binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his foot come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eye stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put it hand into it pocket and pulled out a blood red stone it winked and put the stone back in it pocket and a it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hand with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out of the way he said a harry moved aside he felt the sorcerer stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five pace before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lip he lie he lie potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to him facetoface master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this harry felt a if devil snare wa rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched a quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what wa going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there wa a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it wa chalk white with glaring red eye and slit for nostril like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his leg wouldnt move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their heart and mind unicorn blood ha strengthened me these past week you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys leg he stumbled backward dont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end a your parent they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell wa walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face wa now smiling how touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parent were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she wa trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt a though it wa about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his finger they were blistering before his eye seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his foot landing on top of him both hand around harrys neck harrys scar wa almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony master i cannot hold him my hand my hand and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knee let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palm harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance wa to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his foot caught quirrell by the arm and hung on a tight a he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head wa building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shriek and voldemorts yell of kill him kill him and other voice maybe in harrys own head cry harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all wa lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold wa glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arm were too heavy he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it wa a pair of glass how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it wa quirrell he got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the time said dumbledore quirrell doe not have the stone then who doe sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he wa lying in a bed with white linen sheet and next to him wa a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop token from your friend and admirer said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeon between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school know i believe your friend mister fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three day mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be wa the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it wa you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i wa afraid it had a for the stone it ha been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it all for the best but that mean he and his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored to set their affair in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one a young a you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone wa really not such a wonderful thing a much money and life a you could want the two thing most human being would choose above all the trouble is human do have a knack of choosing precisely those thing that are worst for them harry lay there lost for word dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry ive been thinking sir even if the stone gone vol i mean youknowwho call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for thing fear of a name increase fear of the thing yes sir well voldemorts going to try other way of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone ha he no harry he ha not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he show just a little mercy to his follower a his enemy nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other thing id like to know if you can tell me thing i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your question unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time ala the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love a powerful a your mother for you leaf it own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved u is gone will give u some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it wa agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eye on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eye twinkled useful thing your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchen to steal food when he wa here and there something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hate me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way people mind work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your father debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your father memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir there one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it wa one of my more brilliant idea and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprise even me sometimes now enough question i suggest you make a start on these sweet ah bertie botts every flavor bean i wa unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said ala ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse wa a nice woman but very strict just five minute harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that wa the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minute only and she let ron and hermione in harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arm around him again but harry wa glad she held herself in a his head wa still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore wa so worried the whole school talking about it said ron what really happened it wa one of those rare occasion when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumor harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right place and when harry told them what wa under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stone gone said ron finally flamels just going to die thats what i said but dumbledore think that what wa it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he wa off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero wa so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floor dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your father cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully he a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he know more or le everything that go on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping u he just taught u enough to help i dont think it wa an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked it almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the end ofyear feast tomorrow the point are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minute now out she said firmly after a good night sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey a she straightened his many candy box i can cant i professor dumbledore say you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily a though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feast could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door a he spoke a usual when he wa indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tear it all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hand i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it wa the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live a a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tear leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid wa so shocked he stopped cry ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got load hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a present it not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got eh this it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it wa full of wizard photograph smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owl off ter all yer parent old school friend askin fer photo knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall wa already full it wa decked out in the slytherin color of green and silver to celebrate slytherin winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there wa a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moment later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old man wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it ha been hopefully your head are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year start now a i understand it the house cup here need awarding and the point stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve point in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw ha four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventy two a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it wa a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent event must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smile faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute point to dish out let me see yes first to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts ha seen in many year i award gryffindor house fifty point gryffindor cheer nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the star overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefect my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there wa silence again second to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty point hermione buried her face in her arm harry strongly suspected she had burst into tear gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred point up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty point the din wa deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo point exactly the same a slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kind of courage said dumbledore smiling it take a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemy but just a much to stand up to our friend i therefore award ten point to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud wa the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer a neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much a a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the rib and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on him which mean dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hand in an instant the green hanging became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took it place snape wa shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snape feeling toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed a though life would be back to normal next year or a normal a it ever wa at hogwarts it wa the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain troll he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam result were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good mark hermione of course had the best grade of the first year even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potion one they had hoped that goyle who wa almost a stupid a he wa mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it wa a shame but a ron said you couldnt have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobe were empty their trunk were packed nevilles toad wa found lurking in a corner of the toilet note were handed out to all student warning them not to use magic over the holiday i always hope theyll forget to give u these said fred weasley sadly hagrid wa there to take them down to the fleet of boat that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing a the countryside became greener and tidier eating bertie botts every flavor bean a they sped past muggle town pulling off their wizard robe and putting on jacket and coat pulling into platform nine and threequarters at king cross station it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard wa up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in two and three so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles you must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them a they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where im going i promise you said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together there he is mom there he is look it wa ginny weasley ron younger sister but she wasnt pointing at ron harry potter she squealed look mom i can see be quiet ginny and it rude to point mr weasley smiled down at them busy year she said very said harry thanks for the fudge and the sweater mr weasley oh it wa nothing dear ready are you it wa uncle vernon still purplefaced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry you must be harrys family said mr weasley in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry up boy we havent got all day he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione see you over the summer then hope you have er a good holiday said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant oh i will said harry and they were surprised at the grin that wa spreading over his face they dont know were not allowed to use magic at home im going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer '"

arm supporting the sight gave the creep the restricted section wa right the back the library stepping carefully the rope separated these book the rest the library held his lamp read the title they didnt tell much their peeling faded gold letter spelled word language harry couldnt understand some had title all one book had a dark stain looked horribly like blood the hair the back harrys neck prickled maybe wa imagining maybe thought a faint whispering wa coming the book though they knew someone wa shouldnt had start somewhere setting the lamp carefully the floor looked along the bottom shelf interestinglooking book a large black silver volume caught his eye pulled difficulty wa very heavy balancing his knee let fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book wa screaming harry snapped shut the shriek went one high unbroken earsplitting note stumbled backward knocked his lamp went once panicking heard footstep coming the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back the shelf ran passed filch the doorway filchs pale wild eye looked straight harry slipped filchs outstretched arm streaked the corridor the book shriek still ringing his ear came a sudden halt front a tall suit armor had been busy getting away the library hadnt paid attention wa going perhaps wa dark didnt recognize wa all wa a suit armor near the kitchen knew must five floor

a narrow corridor they came much nearer theyd knock right the cloak didnt stop being solid backed away quietly could a door stood ajar his left wa his hope squeezed holding his breath trying move his relief managed get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past harry leaned the wall breathing deeply listening their footstep dying away had been close very close wa a few second noticed anything the room had hidden looked like unused classroom the dark shape desk chair piled the wall wa upturned wastepaper basket propped the wall facing wa something didnt look

spot unicorn blood here there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if it this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry hermione hoisted them the path behind a towering oak he pulled an arrow fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready fire the three them listened something wa slithering over dead leaf nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid wa squinting the dark path a few second the sound faded away i knew it he murmured there summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow careful now they walked more slowly ear straining the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved who there hagrid called show yerself im armed into the clearing came wa it a man a horse the waist a man red hair beard that wa a horse gleaming chestnut body a long reddish tail harry hermiones jaw dropped oh it you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward shook the centaur hand good evening you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going

hagrid arm hagrid look red spark the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay the path ill come back yeh they heard him crashing away the undergrowth stood looking each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything the rustling leaf around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy if somethings got neville it our fault he here in the first place the minute dragged their ear seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed be picking every sigh the wind every cracking twig what wa going were the others last a great crunching noise

time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set into the heart the forest with malfoy fang they walked nearly half an hour deeper deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible follow because the tree were so thick harry thought the blood seemed be getting thicker there were splash the root a tree though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close harry could see a clearing ahead the tangled branch of an ancient oak look he murmured holding his arm stop malfoy something bright white wa gleaming the ground they inched closer it wa the unicorn all right it wa dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful sad it long slender leg were stuck odd angle where it had fallen it mane wa spread pearlywhite the dark leaf harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered then of the shadow a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered it head over the wound in the animal side began drink it blood aaaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let a terrible scream bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised it head looked right harry unicorn blood wa dribbling it front it got it foot came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it wa though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hoof behind him galloping something jumped clean over harry charging the figure the pain in harrys head wa so bad he fell his knee it took a minute two pas when he looked the figure had gone a centaur wa standing over him not ronan bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry his foot yes thank you what wa that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eye like pale sapphire he looked carefully harry his eye lingering on the scar that stood livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially you can you ride it be quicker this way my name is firenze he added he lowered himself on his front leg so that harry could clamber onto his back there wa suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan bane came bursting the tree their flank heaving sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaf this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not set the heaven have we not read what is come in the movement of

concerned with what been foretold it is not our business run around like donkey stray human in our forest firenze suddenly reared on his hind leg in anger so that harry had grab his shoulder stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it wa killed have the planet not let you in on that secret i set what is lurking in this forest bane yes with human alongside if i must firenze whisked around with harry clutching on best he could they plunged into the tree leaving ronan bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what wa going on why bane so angry he asked what wa that thing you saved from anyway firenze slowed a walk warned harry keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branch did not answer harrys question they made their way the tree in silence so long that harry thought firenze didnt want talk him anymore they were passing a particularly dense patch of tree however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used no said harry startled the odd question weve only used the horn tail hair in potion that is because it is a monstrous thing slay a unicorn said firenze only one nothing lose everything gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn keep you alive even if you are an inch from death at a terrible price you have slain something pure defenseless save you have a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touch your lip harry stared at the back of firenze head wa dappled silver in the moonlight whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going be cursed forever death better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is stay alive long enough drink something else something that bring you back full strength power something that mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer stone of course the elixir of life i dont understand can you think of nobody waited many year return power clung life awaiting their chance it wa though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the tree he seemed hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him die do you mean harry croaked that wa voz harry harry are you all right hermione wa running toward them the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he wa saying the unicorn dead hagrid it in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured hagrid hurried examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planet have been read wrongly before now even by centaur i hope this is one of those time he turned cantered back into the depth of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting them return he shouted something about quidditch foul when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of second though he wa wide eyed harry began tell him hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit he paced in front of the fire he wa still shaking snape want the stone voldemort voldemorts waiting in the forest all this time we thought snape just wanted get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved he shouldnt have done so bane wa furious he wa talking about interfering with what the planet say is going happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane think firenze should have let voldemort kill i suppose thats written in the star well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got wait now is snape steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able come finish well i suppose bane be happy hermione looked very frightened she had a word of comfort harry everyone say dumbledores the only one youknowwho wa ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway say the centaur are right it sound like fortunetelling professor mcgonagall say thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went bed exhausted their throat sore the night surprise werent over when harry pulled back his sheet he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there wa a note pinned it just in case the trapdoor in year come harry would never quite remember how he had managed get his exam when he half expected voldemort come bursting the door at any moment yet the day crept by there could be no doubt that fluffy wa still alive well behind the locked door it wa sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written paper they had been given special new quill the exam had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exam well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox point were given for how pretty the snuffbox wa taken away if it had whisker snape made them all nervous breathing their neck while they tried remember how make a forgetfulness potion harry did the best he could trying ignore the stabbing pain in his forehead had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerve because harry couldnt sleep the truth wa that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it wa now worse than ever because there wa a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it wa because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest because they didnt have scar burning on their forehead ron hermione didnt seem worried about the stone harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them he didnt keep visiting them in dream they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time fret about what snape anyone else might be their very last exam wa history of magic one hour of answering question about batty old wizard whod invented selfstirring cauldron theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam result came when the ghost of professor binns told them put their quill roll their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the rest that wa far easier than i thought it would be said hermione they joined the crowd flocking onto the sunny ground i neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked go their exam paper afterward ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered the lake flopped a tree the weasley twin lee jordan were tickling the tentacle of a giant squid wa basking in the warm shallow no more studying ron sighed happily stretching on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find how badly weve done there no need worry yet harry wa rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this mean he burst angrily my scar keep hurting it happened before never often this go madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry i think it a warning it mean danger

ripped once he not going try it in a hurry neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid let dumbledore harry nodded he couldnt shake a lurking feeling that there wa something hed forgotten do something important when he tried explain this hermione said thats just the exam i woke last night wa halfway through my transfiguration note before i remembered wed done that one harry wa quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in it mouth hagrid wa the only one ever sent him letter hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how get past fluffy never harry suddenly jumped his foot where re you going said ron sleepily ive just thought of something

else is a dragon a stranger turn just happens have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon egg if it against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before what are you talking about said ron harry sprinting across the ground toward the forest didnt answer hagrid wa sitting in an armchair outside his house his trouser sleeve were rolled he wa

inside it wa professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of book we want see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated a though this wa a very fishy thing want do why harry swallowed now what it sort of secret he said he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostril flared professor dumbledore left ten minute ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic flew off for london at once he gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he ha many demand on his time this is important something you have say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution the wind professor it about the sorcerer stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the book she wa carrying tumbled out of her arm she didnt pick them how do you know she spluttered professor i think i know that sn that someone going try steal the stone ive got talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone rest assured no one can possibly steal it it too well protected professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent gathered the fallen book i suggest you all go back outside enjoy the sunshine they didnt it tonight said harry once he wa sure professor mcgonagall wa out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight he found out everything he need now he got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turn what can we hermione gasped harry ron wheeled round snape wa standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were harry began without any idea what he wa going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre to something gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more point can it harry flushed they turned to go outside snape called them back be warned potter any more nighttime wandering i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone step harry turned to the others right here what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of u ha got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom follow him if he leaf it hermione youd better do that why it obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut said hermione she agreed to go watch out for snape wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told ron come on that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned again this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantment she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear youve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty point from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open hermione came in im sorry harry she wailed snape came out asked what i wa doing so i said i wa waiting for flitwick snape went to get him ive only just got away i dont know where snape went well thats it then isnt it harry said the other two stared at him he wa pale his eye were glittering im going out of here tonight im going to try get to the stone first youre mad said ron you cant said hermione what mcgonagall snape have said youll be expelled so what harry shouted dont you understand if snape get hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it wa like when he wa trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark art losing point doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you your family alone if gryffindor win the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys wait for voldemort to find there it only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight nothing you two say is going

three of u said ron all all three of u oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without u id better go look through my book there might be something useful if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told in secret that i got a hundred twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing out that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this wa the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione wa skimming through all her note hoping to come across one of the enchantment they were about to try to break harry ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied a people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered a lee jordan finally left stretching yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he pulled out the cloak then his eye fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singing he ran back to the common room wed better put the cloak on here make sure it cover all three of u if filch spot one of our foot wandering along on it own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad looked a though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty face youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important neville wa clearly steeling himself to do something desperate i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole dont be an idiot dont you call an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rule you were the one told to stand to people yes not to u said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took a step forward neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try hit said neville raising his fist im ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arm snapped to his side his leg sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood then fell flat on his face stiff a a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaw were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eye were moving looking at them in horror whatve you done to him harry whispered it the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron a they stepped over him pulled on the invisibility cloak leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statue shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeve swooping on them at the foot of the first set of stair they spotted mr norris skulking near the top oh let kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear harry shook his head a they climbed carefully around her mr norris turned her lamplike eye on them didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase to the third floor peeve wa bobbing halfway loosening the carpet so that people would trip who there he said suddenly a they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eye know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose in the air floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea peeve he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron ha his own reason for being invisible peeve almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time hovered about a foot off the stair so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeve croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeve rising in the air again hope your business go well baron ill not bother you he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron a few second later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor the door wa already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what wa facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open a the door creaked low rumbling growl met their ear all three of the dog nose sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at it foot hermione whispered look like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake the moment you stop playing said harry well here go he put hagrids flute to his lip blew it wasnt really a tune from the first note the beast eye began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dog growl ceased it tottered on it paw fell to it knee then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry a they slipped out of the cloak crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dog hot smelly breath a they approached the giant head i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog back want to go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth stepped carefully over the dog leg he bent pulled the ring of the trapdoor swung up open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing just black there no way of climbing well just have to drop harry who wa still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing go give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few second silence the dog growled twitched the moment hermione began to play it fell back into it deep sleep harry climbed over it looked through the trapdoor there wa no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he wa hanging on by his fingertip then he looked up at ron said if anything happens to dont follow go straight to the owlery send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope harry let go cold damp air rushed past him a he fell down flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up felt around his eye not used to the gloom it felt a though he wa sitting on some sort of plant it okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp wa the open trapdoor it a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry whats this stuff were his first word dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose it here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there wa a loud bark from the dog hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be mile under the school she said lucky this plant thing here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendril around her ankle a for harry ron their leg had already been bound tightly in long creeper without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror a the two boy fought to pull the plant off them the more they strained against it the tighter faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is it devil snare oh im so glad we know what it called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it a it curled around his chest devil snare devil snare what did professor sprout say it like the dark the damp so light a fire harry choked yes of course there no wood hermione cried wringing her hand have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something sent a jet of the same bluebell flame she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of second the two boy felt it loosening it grip a it cringed away from the light warmth wriggling flailing it unraveled from their body they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry a he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis there no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway wa the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footstep wa the gentle drip of water trickling down the wall the passageway sloped downward harry wa reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragon said to be guarding vault in the wizard bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think it a ghost i dont know sound like wing to there light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber it ceiling arching high above them it wa full of small jewel bright bird fluttering tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber wa a heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack u if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious i suppose if they all swooped down at once well there no other choice ill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arm sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beak claw tearing at him any second nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle it wa locked the other two followed him they tugged heaved at the door it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these bird they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the bird soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not bird harry said suddenly theyre key winged key look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of key yes look broomstick weve got to catch the key to the door there are hundred of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of key they grabbed snatched but the bewitched key darted dived so quickly it wa almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though wa harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting thing other people didnt after a minute weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feather he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing a if it had already been caught stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wing the feather are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry wa pointing crashed into the ceiling nearly fell off his broom weve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eye off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below stop it from going down ill try catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron hermione cheer echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber wa so dark they couldnt see anything at all but a they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessman were all taller than they were carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white piece harry ron hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessman had no face now what do we do harry whispered it obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the room behind the white piece they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessman he walked up to a black knight put his hand out to touch the knight horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this need thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black piece harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell u what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you im going to be a knight said ron the chessman seemed to have been listening because at these word a knight a bishop and a castle turned their back on the white piece and walked off the board leaving three empty square that harry ron and hermione took white always play first in chess said ron peering across the board yes look a white pawn had moved forward two square ron started to direct the black piece they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knee were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four square to the right their first real shock came when their other knight wa taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaf you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men wa lost the white piece showed no mercy soon there wa a huddle of limp black player slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost a many white piece a they had lost black one were nearly there he muttered suddenly let think let think the white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly it the only way ive got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifice i make my move and shell take that leaf you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone there wa no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked a if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three space to the left the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys foot they had won the chessman parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway what if he hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprout that wa the devil snare flitwick mustve put charm on the key mcgonagall transfigured the chessman to make them alive that leaf quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostril making both of them pull their robe up over their nose eye watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on it head im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered a they stepped carefully over one of it massive leg come on i cant breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there wa nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottle standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it wa purple at the same instant black flame shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottle harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lie before you while safety lie behind two of u will help you whichever you would find one among u seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of u are killer waiting hidden in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clue four first however slyly the poison

different size neither dwarf giant hold death in their inside fourth the second left and the second on the right are twin once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she wa smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic it logic a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizard havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever but so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottle three are poison two are wine one will get u safely through the black fire and one will get u back through the purple but how do we know to drink give a minute hermione read the paper several time then she walked up and down the line of bottle muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hand got it she said the smallest bottle will get u through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle there only enough there for one of u he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other one will get you back through the purple flame hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab broom from the flyingkey room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him really but harry what if youknow who with him well i wa lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arm around him hermionel harry youre a great wizard you know im not a good a you said harry very embarrassed a she let go of him said hermione book and cleverness there are more important thing friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefull you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered it not poison said harry anxiously no but it like ice quick go before it wear off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flame here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it wa indeed a though ice wa flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flame licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he wa on the other side in the last chamber there wa already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort the man with two face it wa quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus doe seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor st stuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried to kill no no no tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked over a she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few second and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape wa trying to save of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he wa trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teacher thought snape wa trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his finger rope sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen coming to look at what wa guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with troll you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else wa running around looking for it snape who already suspected went straight to the third floor to head off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snape leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it wa only then that harry realized what wa standing behind quirrell it wa the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but he in london ill be far away by the time he get back all harry could think of doing wa to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he wa on to by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected all along tried to frighten a though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the rope binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate so much oh he doe said quirrell casually heaven yes he wa at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few day ago sobbing i thought snape wa threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master instruction he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he wa there in the classroom with you harry gasped he is with wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i wa then full of ridiculous idea about good and evil lord voldemort showed how wrong i wa there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many time he ha had to be very hard on quirrell shivered suddenly he doe not forgive mistake easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he wa most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry wa remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hand with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break it harrys mind wa racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell doe so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which mean ill see where it hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the rope around his ankle were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he wa still talking to himself what doe this mirror do how doe it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hand once and the rope binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his foot come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eye stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put it hand into it pocket and pulled out a blood red stone it winked and put the stone back in it pocket and a it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hand with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out of the way he said a harry moved aside he felt the sorcerer stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five pace before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lip he lie he lie potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to him facetoface master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this harry felt a if devil snare wa rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched a quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what wa going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there wa a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it wa chalk white with glaring red eye and slit for nostril like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his leg wouldnt move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their heart and mind unicorn blood ha strengthened me these past week you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys leg he stumbled backward dont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end a your parent they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell wa walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face wa now smiling how touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parent were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she wa trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt a though it wa about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his finger they were blistering before his eye seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his foot landing on top of him both hand around harrys neck harrys scar wa almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony master i cannot hold him my hand my hand and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knee let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palm harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance wa to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his foot caught quirrell by the arm and hung on a tight a he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head wa building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shriek and voldemorts yell of kill him kill him and other voice maybe in harrys own head cry harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all wa lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold wa glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arm were too heavy he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it wa a pair of glass how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it wa quirrell he got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the time said dumbledore quirrell doe not have the stone then who doe sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he wa lying in a bed with white linen sheet and next to him wa a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop token from your friend and admirer said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeon between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school know i believe your friend mister fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three day mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be wa the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it wa you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i wa afraid it had a for the stone it ha been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it all for the best but that mean he and his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored to set their affair in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one a young a you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone wa really not such a wonderful thing a much money and life a you could want the two thing most human being would choose above all the trouble is human do have a knack of choosing precisely those thing that are worst for them harry lay there lost for word dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry ive been thinking sir even if the stone gone vol i mean youknowwho call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for thing fear of a name increase fear of the thing yes sir well voldemorts going to try other way of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone ha he no harry he ha not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he show just a little mercy to his follower a his enemy nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other thing id like to know if you can tell me thing i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your question unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time ala the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love a powerful a your mother for you leaf it own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved u is gone will give u some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it wa agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eye on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eye twinkled useful thing your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchen to steal food when he wa here and there something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hate me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way people mind work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your father debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your father memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir there one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it wa one of my more brilliant idea and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprise even me sometimes now enough question i suggest you make a start on these sweet ah bertie botts every flavor bean i wa unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said ala ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse wa a nice woman but very strict just five minute harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that wa the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minute only and she let ron and hermione in harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arm around him again but harry wa glad she held herself in a his head wa still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore wa so worried the whole school talking about it said ron what really happened it wa one of those rare occasion when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumor harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right place and when harry told them what wa under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stone gone said ron finally flamels just going to die thats what i said but dumbledore think that what wa it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he wa off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero wa so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floor dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your father cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully he a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he know more or le everything that go on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping u he just taught u enough to help i dont think it wa an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked it almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the end ofyear feast tomorrow the point are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minute now out she said firmly after a good night sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey a she straightened his many candy box i can cant i professor dumbledore say you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily a though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feast could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door a he spoke a usual when he wa indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tear it all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hand i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it wa the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live a a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tear leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid wa so shocked he stopped cry ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got load hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a present it not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got eh this it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it wa full of wizard photograph smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owl off ter all yer parent old school friend askin fer photo knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall wa already full it wa decked out in the slytherin color of green and silver to celebrate slytherin winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there wa a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moment later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old man wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it ha been hopefully your head are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year start now a i understand it the house cup here need awarding and the point stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve point in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw ha four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventy two a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it wa a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent event must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smile faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute point to dish out let me see yes first to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts ha seen in many year i award gryffindor house fifty point gryffindor cheer nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the star overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefect my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there wa silence again second to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty point hermione buried her face in her arm harry strongly suspected she had burst into tear gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred point up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty point the din wa deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo point exactly the same a slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kind of courage said dumbledore smiling it take a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemy but just a much to stand up to our friend i therefore award ten point to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud wa the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer a neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much a a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the rib and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on him which mean dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hand in an instant the green hanging became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took it place snape wa shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snape feeling toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed a though life would be back to normal next year or a normal a it ever wa at hogwarts it wa the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain troll he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam result were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good mark hermione of course had the best grade of the first year even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potion one they had hoped that goyle who wa almost a stupid a he wa mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it wa a shame but a ron said you couldnt have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobe were empty their trunk were packed nevilles toad wa found lurking in a corner of the toilet note were handed out to all student warning them not to use magic over the holiday i always hope theyll forget to give u these said fred weasley sadly hagrid wa there to take them down to the fleet of boat that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing a the countryside became greener and tidier eating bertie botts every flavor bean a they sped past muggle town pulling off their wizard robe and putting on jacket and coat pulling into platform nine and threequarters at king cross station it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard wa up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in two and three so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles you must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them a they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where im going i promise you said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together there he is mom there he is look it wa ginny weasley ron younger sister but she wasnt pointing at ron harry potter she squealed look mom i can see be quiet ginny and it rude to point mr weasley smiled down at them busy year she said very said harry thanks for the fudge and the sweater mr weasley oh it wa nothing dear ready are you it wa uncle vernon still purplefaced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry you must be harrys family said mr weasley in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry up boy we havent got all day he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione see you over the summer then hope you have er a good holiday said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant oh i will said harry and they were surprised at the grin that wa spreading over his face they dont know were not allowed to use magic at home im going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer '"
